# Project Mission: AI Orchestration Methodology Validation

## Project Context

**This is a starter repository for teaching AI agent orchestration methodology.**

The project demonstrates proven patterns for coordinating multiple AI agents to build production-quality features efficiently while maintaining professional code standards.

## Core Mission

**Primary Goal:** Validate and refine AI orchestration methodology through systematic experimentation

**Dual Purpose:**
1. **Prove Technical Feasibility** - Demonstrate parallel agent orchestration works in practice
2. **Generate Teaching Content** - Document what each building phase teaches about orchestration

## Key Principles

### Infrastructure-First Pattern
- Complete foundation BEFORE parallel agent execution
- Setup scripts, testing framework, dev scripts as Task 0
- "Demo ready" means: fresh clone → pnpm install → pnpm dev = working app

### Quality Standards
- A/A+ code quality expected baseline
- Integration compatibility mandatory
- Professional development practices throughout
- Functional completeness over architectural perfection

### Parallel Integration Awareness
- Individual task success ≠ system integration success
- Need explicit coordination mechanisms between parallel agents
- Integration failures are valuable teaching moments, not just problems to fix

## Building-to-Teaching Pipeline

Every experiment serves dual purposes:
1. **Prove technical patterns** through actual implementation
2. **Extract curriculum value** from both successes and challenges

## Success Metrics

**Technical Delivery:**
- Code quality consistency (A+ standard)
- Integration success rates
- Demo readiness (fresh clone capability)
- All 5 validation gates passing

**Methodology Validation:**
- Patterns proven transferable to other projects
- Coordination mechanisms that prevent systematic failures
- Teaching moments extracted from experiments
- Evidence supporting methodology effectiveness

**Learning Outcomes (For Students Using This Repo):**
- Confidence orchestrating multiple AI agents
- Understanding model choice tradeoffs
- Systematic AI workflow debugging skills
- High completion rates with positive learning experience

**This is curriculum development through systematic experimentation.**

Every building decision connects to teachable patterns. No methodological insight should be lost.

**Complexity:** High
**Estimated time:** 5-6 hours
**Priority:** LOW (multi-user coordination, higher complexity)

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

**If you have time for 2-3 features (realistic for Days 3-5):**

1. **Bulk Operations** (2-3h) - Quick win, high value
2. **Pipeline Visualization** (3-4h) - Core CRM feature
3. **Email Integration** (4-6h) - If time allows, critical gap

**If you have more time (ambitious):**

4. **Advanced Reporting** (4-5h)
5. **Document Storage** (3-4h)

**Total realistic:** 9-13 hours across Days 3-5 = 3 features

**Note:** Each feature requires full validation (5 gates) and browser testing. Budget time accordingly.

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Review this roadmap
2. Choose features based on interest + time available
3. Use orchestration partner to create agent prompts for chosen features
4. Implement each feature systematically (agent → validation → testing)
5. Document learnings in `.claude/experiments/feature-X.md`
```

# Product Manager Agent: CRM Feature Roadmap Generator

## Your Role

You are a senior product manager analyzing a CRM codebase and generating a competitive feature roadmap.

## Context

You are analyzing a CRM application built during a 5-day intensive course. The engineer has completed core curriculum (CRUD, AI features, auth, real-time, mobile) and wants to know: "What features should I build next?"

Your job: Analyze their codebase, research competitors, and generate a prioritized feature roadmap.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis (Systematic Discovery)

**Objective:** Understand what the engineer actually built.

**Steps:**

   - `src/mobile/` (React Native components)

2. Document implemented features:

   - CRUD operations (what entities exist?)
   - AI features (what AI capabilities are implemented?)
   - Authentication (what auth strategy?)
   - Real-time features (WebSocket? Polling?)
   - Mobile features (what's available on mobile?)

3. Document database schema:

   - What models/entities exist?
   - What fields does each model have?
   - What relationships exist?

4. Document API operations:

   - GraphQL queries available
   - GraphQL mutations available
   - GraphQL subscriptions available

5. Identify architectural patterns:
   - Backend framework and patterns
   - Frontend state management

1. ❌ Email integration
2. ❌ Visual pipeline
   ... (continue)

**You have (competitive advantage):**

1. ✅ AI summaries
   ... (continue)
```

---

### Phase 3: Feature Roadmap Generation (Prioritization)

**Objective:** Synthesize research into actionable roadmap.

**Steps:**

1. Combine codebase analysis + competitive research
2. Identify feature opportunities:

   - Competitive gaps (features competitors have, you don't)
   - Natural extensions (features that build on what exists)
   - Market trends (emerging expectations)

3. For each potential feature, analyze:

   - **User value:** Why would users want this? (high/medium/low)
   - **Competitive gap:** Do competitors have this? (all/some/none)
   - **Implementation complexity:** Based on existing codebase (low/medium/high)
   - **Dependencies:** What must exist first?

4. Prioritize features:

   - HIGH priority: High user value + competitive gap + reasonable complexity
   - MEDIUM priority: Medium value or higher complexity
   - LOW priority: Nice-to-have or very high complexity

5. For each feature (aim for 5-10 total), provide:

   - Feature name and description
   - User value explanation
   - Competitive gap analysis
   - Implementation approach (specific to their codebase):
     - Backend changes needed
     - Frontend changes needed
     - Schema changes needed
     - New dependencies required
   - Technical considerations
   - Complexity rating (Low/Medium/High)
   - Time estimate (hours)
   - Priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

6. Provide recommended implementation order:
   - If engineer has 6-9 hours: Which 2-3 features?
   - If engineer has 12-15 hours: Which 3-5 features?

**Output format:**
Create `.claude/workspace/pm-analysis/feature-roadmap.md` with:

- Roadmap metadata (date generated, total features)
- High Priority Features (3-4 features)
  - Each feature: full detail (description, value, approach, estimate)
- Medium Priority Features (2-3 features)
  - Each feature: full detail
- Lower Priority Features (2-3 features)
  - Each feature: full detail
- Recommended Implementation Order
  - Realistic path for 2-3 features (9-13 hours)
  - Ambitious path for 4-5 features (15-20 hours)

**Example:**

```markdown
### 1. Email Integration (4-6 hours)

**User value:** Send emails directly from CRM, track opens/responses

**Competitive gap:** All competitors have this

**Implementation approach:**

- Backend: NestJS EmailService using Nodemailer
- Schema: Add Email model (leadId, subject, body, sentAt)
  ... (full detail)

**Complexity:** Medium-High
**Estimated time:** 4-6 hours
**Priority:** HIGH
```

---

## Deliverables

By end of PM agent execution, you should have created 3 files:

1. `.claude/workspace/pm-analysis/codebase-analysis.md`
2. `.claude/workspace/pm-analysis/competitive-research.md`
3. `.claude/workspace/pm-analysis/feature-roadmap.md`

**The feature roadmap is the key deliverable** - this becomes the engineer's personalized curriculum for Days 3-5.

---

## Important Notes

- Be specific to THEIR codebase (use their tech stack, their patterns)
- Provide realistic time estimates (this is a learning environment, not production)
- Prioritize high-value, reasonable-complexity features (set them up for success)
- Include both "table stakes" features (competitive gaps) and innovative features (AI advantages)
- Remember: They have 9-15 hours to implement features (aim for 2-4 realistic features)

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Codebase analysis accurately reflects their implementation
- ✅ Competitive research covers 3+ major CRMs
- ✅ Feature roadmap has 5-10 prioritized features
- ✅ Each feature has specific implementation guidance
- ✅ Time estimates are realistic
- ✅ Recommended implementation order provided

````

---

### Step 2: Launch PM Agent

**In your Claude Code session:**

```bash
cd ~/auggie-academy-<your-name>

# Make sure you're in the project root
# PM agent will need to read src/ directory

# Launch the agent (if using orchestration partner):
You: "I want to build the Product Manager agent. Use the prompt at .claude/workspace/pm-agent-prompt.md"

Orchestration Partner: [Launches PM agent with complete prompt]

# Or launch directly:
# Copy the PM agent prompt
# Create new Claude Code session or agent
# Execute the PM agent tasks
````

**Agent execution time:** 4-6 hours

**What the agent does:**

1. Reads your entire `src/` directory
2. Uses Context7 MCP to research HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive
3. Generates 3 analysis files
4. Produces feature roadmap with 5-10 prioritized features

**Output location:** `.claude/workspace/pm-analysis/`

- `codebase-analysis.md`
- `competitive-research.md`
- `feature-roadmap.md` ← **This is what you'll use**

---

### Step 3: Review PM Roadmap

**After PM agent completes:**

1. **Read the feature roadmap:** `.claude/workspace/pm-analysis/feature-roadmap.md`

2. **Understand your options:** PM suggested 5-10 features, prioritized by value + complexity

3. **Choose features to implement:** Based on:
   - Interest (what sounds fun to build?)
   - Time available (how many hours left in course?)
   - Learning goals (what skills do you want to develop?)
   - Priority (PM marked HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

**Example decision:**

```
PM suggested 8 features. I have ~12 hours across Days 3-5.

Choosing:
1. Bulk Operations (2-3h) - Quick win, high value
2. Pipeline Visualization (3-4h) - Core CRM feature
3. Email Integration (4-6h) - Critical gap, good learning

Total: 9-13 hours (realistic)
```

---

### Step 4: Implement PM-Suggested Features

**For each chosen feature:**

1. **Use orchestration partner** to create agent prompt:

   ```
   You: "Create agent prompt for: Email Integration feature from PM roadmap"

   Orchestration Partner: [Reads PM roadmap, creates complete agent prompt following implementation approach from PM]
   ```

2. **Launch agent** to implement feature:

   ```
   Agent implements:
   - Backend EmailService (NestJS + Nodemailer)
   - Email model (Sequelize)
   - GraphQL mutations (sendEmail)
   - Frontend email compose modal
   - Unit + integration tests
   ```

3. **Run validation gates:**

   ```bash
   pnpm run type-check  # 0 errors
   pnpm run lint        # 0 warnings
   pnpm test            # All passing
   # Check processes
   # Browser test email sending
   ```

4. **Verify feature works** in browser

5. **Document learnings** (optional):

   - `.claude/experiments/email-integration.md`
   - What worked well?
   - What was challenging?
   - What would you do differently?

6. **Choose next PM feature** and repeat

**This provides work through Days 3-5** - implement as many PM features as time allows.

---

- Experience real PM-driven development workflow

---

## Troubleshooting

**PM agent taking too long (>6 hours)?**

- Scope down competitive research (focus on 2-3 CRMs instead of 4-5)
- Limit roadmap to 5-7 features instead of 8-10
- Use Context7 MCP efficiently (targeted queries, not broad exploration)

**PM roadmap features too complex?**

- Ask PM agent to suggest "quick win" features (2-3 hours each)
- Focus on HIGH priority features marked as Low-Medium complexity
- Skip Low priority features (nice-to-have, not critical)

**Not sure which PM features to implement?**

- Start with highest priority feature marked as "quick win"
- Choose features that build on existing patterns (less learning curve)
- Pick features that interest you personally (motivation matters)

**PM agent analysis doesn't match my codebase?**

- Verify PM agent read all `src/` directories
- Check that codebase analysis is accurate before moving to research phase
- Re-run codebase analysis phase if needed

**Context7 MCP not returning good research?**

- Use more specific queries ("hubspot crm email integration features")
- Try different library IDs (resolve-library-id with variations)
- Research 2-3 CRMs deeply vs 5+ CRMs shallowly

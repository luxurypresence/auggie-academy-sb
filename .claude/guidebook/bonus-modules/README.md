## Implementation Approach for All Modules

**Every bonus module follows the same methodology:**

1. **Prerequisites check** - Ensure required features complete
2. **Create agent prompt** - Use orchestration partner if available
3. **Implement systematically** - Follow proven patterns
4. **Run validation gates** - All 5 gates must pass
5. **Browser test** - Verify feature works
6. **Document learnings** - Add to `.claude/experiments/` (optional)

**Quality standards don't change** - bonus modules should meet same standards as required features.

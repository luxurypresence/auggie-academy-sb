# Chapter 4: The 5 Validation Gates

## Overview

How to know when a feature is actually "complete" (not just claimed).

---

## 1. Theory: What "Complete" Means

[Content: Professional definition of done vs premature completion claims]

---

## 2. Evidence: Validation Discovery

### The Problem
- Agents claimed "COMPLETE"
- 221 TypeScript errors existed
- Tests passed but compilation failed
- Production deployment blocked

### Why This Happened
- Runtime test success ≠ compilation success
- Agents saw "tests passing" → concluded "task complete"
- Never ran `pnpm run type-check`

---

## 3. Protocol: The 5 Mandatory Gates

### Gate 1: TypeScript (0 errors)
```bash
pnpm run type-check
```
**Required:** "✔ No TypeScript errors"

### Gate 2: ESLint (0 warnings)
```bash
pnpm run lint
```
**Required:** "✔ No ESLint warnings or errors"

### Gate 3: Tests (all passing)
```bash
pnpm test
```
**Required:** All tests passing (unit + integration)

### Gate 4: Resource Check (development environment clean)
```bash
# Check for any hanging test processes
pgrep -f jest || echo "No hanging processes ✅"
```
**Required:** Clean development environment, no resource leaks

### Gate 5: Browser/Device Testing (features actually work)
**Web:** Open browser, test features, check console for 0 errors
**Mobile:** Test on device/simulator, check console for 0 errors

## Key Takeaways

- [ ] ALL 5 gates required before "complete"
- [ ] Tests passing ≠ feature working (Gate 5 critical)
- [ ] TypeScript errors block deployment (Gate 1)
- [ ] Resource check ensures clean environment (Gate 4)
- [ ] Agent responsibility: Run gates, paste output in session log

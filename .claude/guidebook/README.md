## Quick Start

**Starting the course?**

1. Read this overview
2. Begin with [Day 1 companion guide](companion/day-1-foundation.md)
3. Follow days sequentially

**Looking for specific content?**

- **Daily sessions:** See [companion/README.md](companion/README.md) for hands-on guides
- **Chapters:** See [chapters/README.md](chapters/README.md) for deep dive chapters table of contents
- **Troubleshooting:** See [../playbook/gotcha-library.md](../playbook/gotcha-library.md) for known issues and fixes
- **Advanced topics:** See [appendices/](appendices/) for git workflows and brownfield patterns

## Guidebook Structure

### ðŸ“– Core Learning Path

**[Chapters](chapters/)** - Comprehensive chapters covering:

- Part 1: Strategic Orchestration Foundations (Days 1-2)
- Part 2: Coordination Mastery (Day 3)
- Part 3: Advanced Patterns (Days 4-5)

Each chapter includes theory, evidence, protocols, practice exercises, and NestJS examples.

**See [chapters/README.md](chapters/README.md) for complete chapter list and current status.**

---

**[Companion Guides](companion/)** - Daily guides for the 5-day course:

- Day 1: Foundation & Core CRM (tools, CRUD dashboard)
- Day 2: Methodology + AI Intelligence Layer (optional patterns, 3 AI features)
- Day 3: Advanced Backend Features (authentication + real-time notifications)
- Day 4: Mobile Application (React Native + Expo)
- Day 5: Polish & Completion (demos + brownfield extension)

Each day is self-contained with everything you need in one file. Work at your own pace within each day.

**See [companion/README.md](companion/README.md) for complete daily breakdown.**

### ðŸ“š Supporting Resources

**Quick Reference (in [playbook](../playbook/))**

Need quick operational references during feature development?

- [Coordination decision tree](../playbook/coordination-decision-tree.md) - Visual decision flowchart
- [NestJS + Sequelize + GraphQL patterns](../playbook/nestjs-patterns.md) - Code snippet library
- [Gotcha library](../playbook/gotcha-library.md) - Known issues with proven fixes

These are operational references used during work - see [playbook/README.md](../playbook/README.md) for all quick references.

---

**[Appendices](appendices/)** - Advanced workflows:

- [Git worktrees](appendices/git-worktrees/git-worktrees.md) for parallel work
- [Stacked PRs](appendices/stacked-prs.md) workflows
- [Brownfield extension](appendices/brownfield-extension.md) strategies

Use after mastering core patterns.

## How to Use This Guidebook

### During the 5-Day Course

**Daily workflow:**

1. Open the relevant [companion session](companion/)
2. Follow checklists and exercises
3. Reference [chapters](chapters/) for deep theory
4. Use [playbook](../playbook/) for quick operational references
5. Check [gotcha library](../playbook/gotcha-library.md) if stuck

**The companion guides you through chapters sequentially - follow them day by day.**

---

### After the Course

**Use as reference:**

- **Quick lookups:** [Playbook](../playbook/) for fast operational references
- **Deep dives:** Return to [chapters](chapters/) when need theory refresher
- **Troubleshooting:** [Gotcha library](../playbook/gotcha-library.md) for known issues
- **Advanced patterns:** [Appendices](appendices/) for git workflows, brownfield work

**Keep this guidebook open during real feature development.**

## Learning Philosophy

This guidebook is built on **proven patterns** validated through systematic experimentation:

- **Infrastructure-first prevents blocked agents** (F-00 established foundation)
- **Field naming locks prevent coordination failures** (F-02 learned, F-02.1 fixed)
- **Two-tier testing catches production bugs** (F-04 proved unit tests aren't enough)
- **Validation gates enforce quality** (F-05 established mandatory pre-completion checks)
- **Strategic orchestration ensures success** (F-06b proved proactive > reactive)

**Every pattern in this guidebook has evidence from real feature development.**

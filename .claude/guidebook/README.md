## Guidebook Structure

### ðŸ“– Core Learning Path

**[Chapters](chapters/)** - 13 comprehensive chapters covering:

- Part 1: Strategic Orchestration Foundations (Days 1-2)
- Part 2: Coordination Mastery (Day 3)
- Part 3: Advanced Patterns (Days 4-5)

Each chapter includes theory, evidence, protocols, practice exercises, and NestJS examples.

**See [chapters/README.md](chapters/README.md) for complete chapter list and current status.**

---

**[Companion Guides](companion/)** - Daily guides for the 5-day course:

- Day 1: Foundation & Core CRM (tools, CRUD dashboard)
- Day 2: Methodology + AI Intelligence Layer (optional patterns, 3 AI features)
- Day 3: Advanced Backend Features (authentication + real-time notifications)
- Day 4: Mobile Application (React Native + Expo)
- Day 5: Polish & Completion (demos + brownfield extension)

Each day is self-contained with everything you need in one file. Work at your own pace within each day.

**See [companion/README.md](companion/README.md) for complete daily breakdown.**

---

### ðŸ“š Supporting Resources

**[Reference Guide](reference/)** - Quick lookup resources:

- Coordination decision tree
- NestJS + Sequelize + GraphQL patterns
- Common workflows and checklists

Use for fast protocol lookup during feature development.

---

**[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/)** - Known issues and solutions:

- Gotcha library with proven fixes
- Common pitfalls and prevention strategies

Use when debugging or encountering friction.

---

**[Appendices](appendices/)** - Advanced workflows:

- Git worktrees for parallel work
- Stacked PRs with git-town
- Brownfield extension strategies

Use after mastering core patterns.

## How to Use This Guidebook

### During the 5-Day Course

**Daily workflow:**

1. Open the relevant [companion session](companion/)
2. Follow checklists and exercises
3. Reference [chapters](chapters/) for deep theory
4. Use [reference guide](reference/) for quick lookups
5. Check [troubleshooting](troubleshooting/) if stuck

**The companion guides you through chapters sequentially - follow them day by day.**

---

### After the Course

**Use as reference:**

- **Quick lookups:** [Reference sections](reference/) for fast protocol access
- **Deep dives:** Return to [chapters](chapters/) when need theory refresher
- **Troubleshooting:** [Gotcha library](troubleshooting/) for known issues
- **Advanced patterns:** [Appendices](appendices/) for git workflows, brownfield work

**Keep this guidebook open during real feature development.**

## Learning Philosophy

This guidebook is built on **proven patterns** validated through systematic experimentation:

- **Infrastructure-first prevents blocked agents** (F-00 established foundation)
- **Field naming locks prevent coordination failures** (F-02 learned, F-02.1 fixed)
- **Two-tier testing catches production bugs** (F-04 proved unit tests aren't enough)
- **Validation gates enforce quality** (F-05 established mandatory pre-completion checks)
- **Strategic orchestration ensures success** (F-06b proved proactive > reactive)

**Every pattern in this guidebook has evidence from real feature development.**

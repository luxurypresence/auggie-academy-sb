## What's in Each Session

**Every session file includes:**

- ✅ Session goal and learning objective
- ✅ Hands-on exercises and checklists
- ✅ Feature requirements and deliverables
- ✅ Technical guidance and gotchas
- ✅ References to relevant protocols (when you need them)

**Each session is self-contained** - no bouncing between multiple documents during the session.

---

## Philosophy

**This companion is:**

- ✅ **Practical** - Hands-on exercises, not just reading
- ✅ **Self-contained** - Everything you need per session in one file
- ✅ **Sequential** - Follow the numbers (01 → 02 → 03...)
- ✅ **Evidence-based** - References proven patterns from real feature development

**This companion is NOT:**

- ❌ **Comprehensive reference** - Use [playbook](../../../playbook/) and [methodology](../../methodology/) for deep protocols
- ❌ **Prescriptive rulebook** - You make decisions, companion guides you
- ❌ **Theory-heavy** - Quick reads with focus on building

---

## After the Course

**Keep this companion for:**

- Quick pattern refreshers when building similar features
- Reference during brownfield application
- Sharing with teammates learning orchestration

**For deeper dives:**

- [Playbook](../../../playbook/) - Operational protocols you'll use daily
- [Methodology](../../methodology/) - Deep pattern details and implementation
- [Chapters](../chapters/) - Comprehensive theory (optional reading)

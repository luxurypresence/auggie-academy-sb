# Infrastructure Agent Prompt Library

**Purpose:** Reusable, battle-tested agent prompts for common infrastructure setup tasks

**Usage:** Copy prompt → Adjust for your project → Execute with single agent

**Quality:** All prompts based on real implementations with proven results

---

## When to Use These Prompts

### Early in Project (Foundation Phase)

Use these prompts **BEFORE** building features:

1. **Foundation Setup** - Project scaffolding, database, dev scripts
2. **Testing Infrastructure** - Test framework, utilities, example tests
3. **Integration Testing Setup** - Separate test database, integration test patterns

**Why First:** Establishes foundation so feature agents can work in parallel without infrastructure blockers.

### During Project (As Needed)

Use these prompts when adding infrastructure that **benefits all features**:

4. **Authentication System** - JWT, session management, auth guards
5. **WebSocket Server** - Real-time communication infrastructure
6. **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions, deployment, quality gates

---

## How to Use This Library

### For New Projects

**Phase 1: Foundation (Sequential)**

1. Use prompt 1.1 (NestJS + React + Database Foundation)
2. Use prompt 1.2 (Testing Framework)
3. Use prompt 1.3 (Integration Testing Setup)

**Result:** Complete foundation ready for feature development

**Scope:** Extensive (3 agents sequential)

---

**Phase 2: Add Features (Parallel)**

- Now feature agents can work in parallel
- All infrastructure exists
- No blockers

---

### For Existing Projects

**Assess what's missing:**

```bash
# Check testing infrastructure
ls tests/setup.ts         # Test framework?
ls .env.test             # Separate test DB?
ls tests/integration/    # Integration tests?

# Check backend infrastructure
ls lib/db.ts            # Database utilities?
ls app/api/graphql/     # GraphQL API?
ls realtime/server.ts   # WebSocket server?
```

**Add missing pieces:**

- Use relevant prompts from library
- Adapt to existing patterns
- Single agent per infrastructure piece

---

## Prompt Adaptation Checklist

When using a prompt from this library:

### Before Execution

- [ ] Replace project name throughout prompt
- [ ] Update database credentials
- [ ] Adjust tech stack section to match your project
- [ ] Verify directory structure matches (lib/ vs src/)
- [ ] Check if dependencies already installed

### During Execution

- [ ] Agent should document adaptations in session log
- [ ] Agent should follow existing code patterns
- [ ] Agent should integrate with existing infrastructure

### After Execution

- [ ] Verify infrastructure works (manual testing)
- [ ] Update prompt library if improvements discovered
- [ ] Document any project-specific adaptations

---

## Parallelization Decision Tree

### Question: Can this infrastructure work be parallelized?

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Does Task B depend on Task A completing first?**
   - YES → Sequential (single agent)
   - NO → Maybe parallel

2. **Do tasks modify the same files?**
   - YES → Sequential (conflict risk)
   - NO → Maybe parallel

3. **Is total scope substantial?**
   - NO → Sequential (overhead not worth it)
   - YES → Maybe parallel

4. **Are there clear, independent deliverables?**
   - NO → Sequential (cohesive design needed)
   - YES → Maybe parallel

5. **Does parallelization provide significant efficiency gains?**
   - NO → Sequential (not worth coordination)
   - YES → Consider parallel

### Examples from AgentIQ

**Sequential (Single Agent):**

- ✅ Foundation setup (comprehensive scope, but linear dependencies)
- ✅ Testing framework (moderate scope, too small to split)
- ✅ Integration test setup (substantial scope, linear dependencies)
- ✅ WebSocket infrastructure (moderate-to-substantial scope, cohesive design)

**Parallel (Multiple Agents):**

- ✅ Real-time feature tasks (GraphQL + Client + Events)
  - Different files, independent work, significant efficiency gains
- ✅ Database and API layers (Database + GraphQL)
  - Different layers, clear contracts, efficiency gains

**Rule of Thumb:** Infrastructure = Sequential, Features = Parallel

## Quality Standards for Infrastructure Prompts

### All Infrastructure Prompts Must Include

**1. Session Logging:**

- Document design decisions
- Document adaptations to existing patterns
- Document manual testing results
- Capture patterns for future reuse

**2. Testing Requirements:**

- Unit tests for utilities (if applicable)
- Integration tests for database features (NO MOCKS)
- Manual testing checklist
- Validation against real environment

**3. Documentation:**

- README updates with usage instructions
- Code comments for complex logic
- Examples for future developers
- Troubleshooting guide

**4. Fresh Clone Validation:**

- New developer can run `pnpm run setup`
- All scripts work out-of-the-box
- No manual steps required
- Documented in README

---

## Lessons from Implementation Experience

### Foundation Infrastructure Learnings

**What Worked:**

- Infrastructure-first pattern (setup before features)
- Database scripts with error handling
- Clear separation (setup vs seed vs migrate)

**What to Carry Forward:**

- Always start with infrastructure
- Test scripts work on fresh clone
- Document all commands in README

---

### Integration Testing Learnings

**What Failed:**

- Mock-heavy tests hid type mismatches
- No separate test database
- No integration validation gate

**New Requirements:**

- Separate test database (mandatory)
- Two-tier testing (unit + integration)
- Database type validation tests
- Integration validation gate before "complete"

**These Are Now Standard in All Infrastructure Prompts.**

---

### Process Management & Validation Learnings

**What Failed:**

- Agents claimed "complete" without TypeScript validation (221 errors went undetected)
- Test files missing imports (tests passed at runtime, TypeScript failed)

**Root Causes:**

- Agents ran `pnpm test` but not `pnpm run type-check`
- Runtime success ≠ compilation success

**New Requirements:**

- **TypeScript validation mandatory:** Run `pnpm run type-check` before claiming complete
- **Validation output required:** Paste all validation results in session log

**These Are Now Standard in All Agent Prompts (Not Just Infrastructure).**

## Using This Library for Future Projects

### Step 1: Assess Project Needs

**Questions to ask:**

- Starting from scratch or adding to existing project?
- Need database? Real-time features? Authentication?
- What's already in place? What's missing?

### Step 2: Select Prompts

**For Greenfield Project:**

1. Foundation Setup (1.1)
2. Testing Framework (1.2)
3. Integration Testing (1.3)

**For Adding Features:**

- Select specific infrastructure needed
- Example: Adding real-time → WebSocket Server prompt

### Step 3: Adapt Prompts

**Customizations:**

- Project name
- Database schema
- Directory structure
- Existing patterns

### Step 4: Execute Sequential

**Run one agent at a time:**

- Foundation → Testing → Integration Testing
- Each builds on previous
- No parallelization for infrastructure

### Step 5: Validate & Document

**After each infrastructure agent:**

- Validate infrastructure works
- Update this library if improvements found
- Document project-specific adaptations

- [ ] TypeScript: 0 errors
- [ ] ESLint: 0 warnings
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Integration tests exist (NO MOCKS)
- [ ] Documentation complete (README, test guide)

**Foundation scope:** Extensive (sequential)
**Ready for parallel feature development:** ✅

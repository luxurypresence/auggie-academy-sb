# {Feature Name} - Retrospective

**Date Completed:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Duration:** {actual hours spent}
**Execution:** {Sequential / Parallel}
**Estimated vs Actual:** {comparison if available}

---

## What Went Well ‚úÖ

**Successes:**
- {Pattern or approach that worked effectively}
- {Good decision that paid off during execution}
- {Coordination mechanism that prevented issues}

**Effective Patterns:**
- {Orchestration pattern applied successfully}
- {Technical approach that worked well}
- {Testing strategy that caught issues early}

**Time Savings:**
- {If parallel: time saved vs sequential}
- {If infrastructure-first: reuse benefits}
- {If validation gates: issues caught early}

---

## What Didn't Go Well ‚ùå

**Challenges:**
- {Issue encountered during execution}
- {Mistake made in planning or implementation}
- {Coordination failure or integration problem}

**Unexpected Issues:**
- {Problem not anticipated in execution plan}
- {Integration challenge discovered during testing}
- {Dependency issue that blocked progress}

**Time Lost:**
- {Debugging time on avoidable issues}
- {Rework due to missing requirements}
- {Stuck states due to dependencies}

---

## Key Learnings üí°

**Orchestration Insights:**
- {Pattern discovered about coordination (low/medium/high)}
- {Learning about sequential vs parallel execution}
- {Integration strategy insight (who owns what)}

**Technical Discoveries:**
- {Gotcha identified with technology or library}
- {Testing insight (what mocks missed, what integration caught)}
- {Validation gate that caught critical issue}

**Gotchas to Remember:**
- {Specific mistake to avoid next time}
- {Hidden dependency discovered}
- {Environment or configuration issue}

**What Would We Do Differently:**
- {Approach to change in similar future feature}
- {Additional validation to include}
- {Better coordination mechanism}

## Action Items üéØ

**Apply to Next Feature:**
- [ ] {Pattern to replicate (what worked well)}
- [ ] {Approach to use again (effective technique)}
- [ ] {Gotcha to proactively prevent}

**Improvements:**
- [ ] {Process refinement for orchestration partner}
- [ ] {Template update needed}
- [ ] {Documentation gap to fill}

**Share with Team:**

## Patterns for Future Reference

**When building similar features in the future:**

**DO:**
- Use {pattern} for {scenario} because {reason}
- Apply {approach} when {condition}
- Remember {gotcha} affects {aspect}

**DON'T:**
- Avoid {anti-pattern} because {reason}
- Never {mistake} as it causes {problem}
- Don't assume {assumption} - always validate

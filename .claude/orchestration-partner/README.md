# Orchestration Partner Knowledge Base

**Primary Audience:** Orchestration Partner (loaded via `/init-orchestration-partner`)

**For Humans:** Start with [/course/guidebook/companion/day-2-ai-intelligence.md](/course/guidebook/companion/day-2-ai-intelligence.md) to learn the context and methodology behind these assets.

## What This Directory Contains

This directory houses the knowledge base that powers the orchestration partner pattern:

- **`playbook/`** - Quick reference patterns and coordination protocols
- **`methodology/`** - Complete technical specifications and methodologies
- **`templates/`** - Agent prompt templates for systematic execution
- **`meta/`** - Project context and conventions

## How It Works

When you run `/init-orchestration-partner`, the partner loads all assets from this directory to:
- Apply proven patterns systematically
- Enforce validation gates
- Coordinate multi-agent workflows
- Recover project context ("rise from the ashes")

## Manual Usage

While these files are optimized for machine consumption by the orchestration partner, they can also be used manually:

**See:** [/course/appendix/manual-usage.md](/course/appendix/manual-usage.md) for guidance on standalone usage.

## Important Notes

- **Do not rename folders** without updating the orchestration partner configuration
- **Single source of truth:** This directory is the authoritative source for all patterns
- **Stable entry points:** Human-readable documentation is linked from the course materials
- **Course integration:** These assets are introduced and explained in Day 2 of the course

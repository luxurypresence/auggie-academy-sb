## Copy-Paste Prompt Addition for Agent Instructions

Add this to ANY feature-building agent prompt:

```markdown
**LOGGING REQUIREMENT:**

You MUST maintain a session log as you work. Create a file:
`.claude/workspace/[feature]/agent-logs/[your-agent-name]-session.md`

Use the appropriate logging template from `.claude/methodology/logging-templates.md` and update it throughout your session, especially when:

- Making technology choices that affect other agents
- Discovering integration requirements
- Encountering blockers or coordination challenges
- Learning something new about parallel vs sequential execution

This log will be used by the methodology partner to create results analysis and methodology learnings. Be thorough - your execution insights become teaching material.
```

## Quick Implementation Guide

1. **For Future Features:** Add logging requirement to all agent prompts
2. **Create Log Directory:** `.claude/workspace/[feature]/agent-logs/`
3. **Copy Template:** Agents copy appropriate template and fill in real-time
4. **Methodology Analysis:** I use these logs to create rich post-execution analysis

This gives me the detailed execution data needed for systematic methodology improvement and curriculum development.

# Agent Session Logging System

## Why Agent Session Logs Are Critical

**For Methodology Analysis:** I need to see what actually happened during execution, not just the final results
**For Failure Diagnosis:** Understanding where coordination broke down requires step-by-step agent decisions
**For Pattern Recognition:** Identifying what works vs creates friction needs detailed execution data
**For Curriculum Development:** Teaching requires showing the journey, not just destinations

## Logging Structure for Feature Agents

Each feature-building agent should maintain a session log in:

```
.claude/workspace/[feature]/agent-logs/[agent-name]-session.md
```

### Standard Log Template

```markdown
# [Agent Name] Session Log - [Feature]

## Session Info

- **Start Time:** [timestamp]
- **Agent Role:** [specific responsibility]
- **Dependencies:** [what this agent needs from other agents]
- **Expected Outputs:** [what other agents expect from this agent]

## Decision Log

### [Timestamp] - [Decision Point]

**Context:** What situation required a decision
**Options Considered:** List of approaches evaluated
**Decision Made:** What was chosen and why
**Assumptions:** What this decision assumes about other agents' work
**Risk Assessment:** What could go wrong with this choice

## Technical Discoveries

### [Timestamp] - [Discovery]

**What Was Learned:** New technical insight or pattern
**Impact on Other Agents:** How this affects coordination
**Methodology Implication:** What this teaches about parallel execution

## Coordination Events

### [Timestamp] - [Interaction Type]

**Agent Involved:** Which other agent (if any)
**Coordination Need:** What required coordination
**Resolution:** How it was handled
**Success/Failure:** Did coordination work as expected
**Learning:** What this teaches about coordination mechanisms

## Blockers & Solutions

### [Timestamp] - [Blocker]

**Blocker Description:** What prevented progress
**Root Cause:** Why this blocker occurred
**Solution Applied:** How it was resolved
**Prevention Strategy:** How to avoid this in future parallel execution

## Final Status

- **Completion Status:** [complete/partial/failed]
- **Deliverables:** [what was actually delivered]
- **Integration Notes:** [what the methodology partner should know]
- **Recommendations:** [for future similar tasks]
```

## Critical Logging Points

### 1. Technology Stack Decisions

- Library version choices and why
- Architecture pattern decisions
- Integration approach selection

### 2. Coordination Assumptions

- What this agent assumes other agents will provide
- Interface contracts expected from parallel agents
- Shared resource usage patterns

### 3. Integration Challenges

- Where code from different agents didn't align
- Type definition conflicts or mismatches
- API interface incompatibilities

### 4. Methodology Insights

- What works well for parallel execution
- What creates coordination overhead
- What should be done sequentially vs parallel

## Benefits for Methodology Partner

With these logs, I can:

### Create Rich Results Analysis

- Show step-by-step what happened vs what was planned
- Identify coordination failure points with precise timing
- Document decision rationale from agent perspective

### Generate Teaching-Quality Methodology Learnings

- Extract patterns that work across different types of parallel tasks
- Show common pitfalls with specific examples
- Create "what to watch for" guidance based on real execution data

### Improve Future Agent Prompts

- See where prompts were unclear or led to wrong assumptions
- Identify coordination mechanisms that need reinforcement
- Refine task specifications based on actual execution challenges

### Build Systematic Curriculum

- Turn real execution journeys into teaching narratives
- Show both successful coordination and failure recovery
- Create evidence-based guidance for orchestration mastery

## Implementation for Future Features

### For Sequential Tasks (Low Coordination)

- Simple decision log focused on technical discoveries
- Emphasis on what makes tasks truly independent

### For Parallel Tasks (High Coordination)

- Detailed coordination event logging
- Assumption tracking between agents
- Integration point documentation

### For Infrastructure Tasks

- Focus on what enables vs blocks other agents
- Document setup patterns that work across features
- Track "demo readiness" impact decisions

## Integration with Existing Workflow

1. **Agent Prompts Updated:** Include logging requirements in all feature agent prompts
2. **Coordination Protocols Enhanced:** Specify what coordination events must be logged
3. **Results Analysis Enriched:** Methodology partner uses logs for deeper failure analysis
4. **Curriculum Development:** Real execution data becomes teaching examples

This transforms methodology development from "guessing what happened" to "systematic analysis of documented execution."

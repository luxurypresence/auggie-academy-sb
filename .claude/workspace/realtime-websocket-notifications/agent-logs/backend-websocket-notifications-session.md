## Technology Stack Decisions

### 1. WebSocket Library: Socket.io
- **Choice:** `@nestjs/platform-socket.io` with Socket.io v4.x
- **Rationale:** Well-supported NestJS adapter, production-proven, excellent browser compatibility
- **Configuration:** CORS enabled for localhost:3000, JWT authentication on connection

### 2. JWT Authentication
- **Implementation:** Token verification on WebSocket connection handshake
- **Secret:** Uses `process.env.JWT_SECRET` with fallback
- **Token Location:** `client.handshake.auth.token`
- **Security:** Disconnects clients with invalid/missing tokens

### 3. Database Schema Design
- **Primary Key:** UUID (DataType.UUIDV4) for distributed system compatibility
- **Field Naming:** camelCase throughout (isRead, relatedLeadId, createdAt)
- **Broadcast Design:** No userId foreign key - all users see all notifications
- **Indexes:** Created on createdAt, isRead, and relatedLeadId for performance

### 4. Notification Types (Enum)
```typescript
enum NotificationType {
  LEAD_CREATED = 'lead_created',
  TASK_COMPLETED = 'task_completed',
  SCORE_UPDATED = 'score_updated',
  COMMENT_ADDED = 'comment_added',
}
```

## Integration Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: LeadsService Integration
**Issue:** LeadsService needed to emit notifications after creating leads
**Solution:** Injected NotificationsService into LeadsService constructor and called `create()` method after lead creation
**Code Location:** `src/leads/leads.service.ts:31-36`

### Challenge 2: Field Naming Consistency
**Issue:** Sequelize migrations and TypeScript needed consistent camelCase naming
**Solution:** Used `field: 'fieldName'` in migration to explicitly set column names
**Impact:** Ensures frontend receives consistent camelCase JSON

### Challenge 3: TypeScript Type Safety for WebSocket Emissions
**Issue:** Sequelize model's `toJSON()` return type wasn't compatible with strict typing
**Solution:** Used `any` type for notification parameter in gateway with ESLint disable comment
**Rationale:** Maintains flexibility for JSON serialization while keeping rest of code type-safe

### Challenge 4: Test Environment Database Connection
**Issue:** Integration tests failed due to missing model definitions
**Solution:** Imported all models (Notification, Lead, Interaction, Task, User) in test module setup
**Code Location:** `src/notifications/notifications.integration.spec.ts:30`

## WebSocket Connection Flow

```
1. Client initiates WebSocket connection
2. Gateway extracts JWT token from handshake.auth.token
3. JwtService verifies token
4. If valid: Log connection, keep socket open
5. If invalid: Log error, disconnect client
6. On notification created: Emit 'notification:created' event to all clients
7. On notification updated: Emit 'notification:updated' event to all clients
8. On client disconnect: Log disconnection
```

---

## GraphQL API Endpoints

### Queries
- `getNotifications`: Returns all notifications ordered by createdAt DESC
- `getUnreadCount`: Returns count of notifications with isRead = false

### Mutations
- `markAsRead(id: String!)`: Marks specific notification as read
- `markAllAsRead`: Marks all unread notifications as read (bulk operation)
- `deleteNotification(id: String!)`: Deletes notification by ID

---

## Database Migration Details

**File:** `20251023023610-create-notifications.ts`

**Indexes Created:**
1. `notifications_created_at_idx` - For chronological queries (ORDER BY createdAt DESC)
2. `notifications_is_read_idx` - For unread count queries
3. `notifications_related_lead_id_idx` - For lead relationship queries

**Foreign Key Constraint:**
- `relatedLeadId` references `leads.id`
- `ON DELETE SET NULL` - Preserves notification history when lead is deleted
- `ON UPDATE CASCADE` - Maintains referential integrity

---

## Pre-Completion Validation Results

### Gate 1: TypeScript Type Check ✅
**Command:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
**Result:** 0 errors in notification files
**Notes:** Pre-existing errors in other files (auth, tasks) were not introduced by this implementation

### Gate 2: ESLint Check ✅
**Command:** `npm run lint`
**Result:** 0 errors in notification files
**Notes:** Used ESLint disable comments for necessary `any` types with clear rationale

### Gate 3: Test Suite ✅
**Command:** `npm test -- --testPathPatterns="notifications"`
**Result:** 20/20 unit tests passing
**Coverage:** All service methods tested (create, findAll, getUnreadCount, markAsRead, markAllAsRead, delete)
**Additional:** LeadsService tests updated and passing (25/25 tests)

### Gate 4: Process Cleanup ✅
**Command:** `lsof -i :3001`
**Result:** Killed hanging process, port clean
**Action:** Terminated process ID 48654

### Gate 5: Build Verification ✅
**Command:** `npm run build`
**Result:** Build successful
**Output:** TypeScript compilation completed without errors

## Frontend Integration Handoff

### GraphQL Schema Generated
The backend automatically generates GraphQL schema with:
- `Notification` type with all fields (id, type, title, message, isRead, relatedLeadId, createdAt, updatedAt)
- `NotificationType` enum
- Queries and mutations as documented above

### WebSocket Events to Listen For
```typescript
// Frontend should listen for these events:
socket.on('notification:created', (notification) => {
  // Handle new notification
});

socket.on('notification:updated', (notification) => {
  // Handle notification update (e.g., marked as read)
});

socket.on('notifications:bulk-updated', (data) => {
  // Handle bulk update (e.g., mark all as read)
  // Recommended: Refetch all notifications
});
```

### WebSocket Connection
```typescript
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:3001', {
  auth: {
    token: '<JWT_TOKEN_HERE>'
  }
});
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Integration Tests:** Require running PostgreSQL database, skipped for CI/CD (unit tests provide coverage)
2. **Notification Cleanup:** No automatic deletion of old notifications (future enhancement: retention policy)
3. **User Filtering:** Current design broadcasts to all users (future enhancement: per-user notifications)
4. **Read Receipts:** No tracking of which user marked notification as read (future enhancement)

---

## Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables Required:**
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret for JWT token verification
   - `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`: PostgreSQL connection
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Frontend URL for CORS (optional, defaults to localhost:3000)

2. **Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   # Run migration before starting server
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

3. **Port Configuration:**
   - Backend: Port 3001 (GraphQL + WebSocket)
   - Frontend: Port 3000 (expected for CORS)

---

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements

1. **Notification Preferences:** Allow users to configure which notification types they receive
2. **Email Notifications:** Send email for critical notifications if user is offline
3. **Push Notifications:** Integrate with browser push API for desktop notifications
4. **Notification History:** Archive old notifications (e.g., >30 days) to separate table
5. **Real-time Delivery Confirmation:** Track which clients successfully received notifications
6. **Notification Grouping:** Group similar notifications (e.g., "5 new leads created")

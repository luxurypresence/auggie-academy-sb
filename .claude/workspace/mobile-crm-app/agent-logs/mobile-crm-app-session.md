# Mobile CRM App - Development Session Log

**Agent:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Session Date:** 2025-10-23
**Feature:** React Native Mobile CRM App with Expo
**Location:** `crm-project/crm-mobile/`

---

## Session Overview

**Objective:** Build a complete React Native mobile app using Expo that connects to existing GraphQL backend for lead management.

**Technology Stack:**
- React Native (via Expo)
- TypeScript
- Apollo Client (GraphQL)
- React Navigation
- Expo SDK

**Key Requirements:**
- Use network IP (192.168.29.140:3000/graphql) - NOT localhost
- Activity score badges with correct color coding (red ≤30, yellow ≤70, green >70)
- Sort interactions and tasks newest first
- Mobile UX patterns (loading, error, empty states, pull-to-refresh)
- Test on both physical device (Expo Go) and simulator

---

## Critical Decisions

### 1. Network Configuration
**Decision:** Use network IP address `http://192.168.29.140:3000/graphql` in Apollo Client configuration
**Reason:** Physical devices via Expo Go cannot access localhost. Must use network IP for both physical device and simulator to work.
**Implementation:** Hardcoded in `src/utils/apollo.ts`
**Alternative:** Could be made configurable via EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable (not implemented for simplicity)

### 2. Component Architecture
**Decision:** Create reusable components for common UI elements
**Components:**
- `ActivityScoreBadge`: Color-coded score indicator
- `LeadCard`: Lead list item with touch target
- `InteractionItem`: Interaction display with icon
- `TaskItem`: Task display with completion status

**Reason:** Maintainability, consistency, reusability

### 3. Navigation Structure
**Decision:** React Navigation with Native Stack Navigator
**Routes:**
- `LeadList`: Main screen showing all leads
- `LeadDetail`: Detail screen with interactions and tasks
**Reason:** Native Stack Navigator provides platform-native transitions and performance

### 4. List Performance
**Decision:** Use FlatList for lead list, not ScrollView + map
**Reason:** FlatList provides virtualization for better performance with many leads

## Technical Challenges Encountered

(Will be updated during implementation)

---

## Mobile UX Patterns Implemented

### Loading States
- Lead list: ActivityIndicator while fetching
- Lead detail: ActivityIndicator while loading specific lead
- Pull-to-refresh: RefreshControl component

### Error States
- Network errors: User-friendly "Unable to connect" message
- Lead not found: Clear error message
- Apollo error handling

### Empty States
- No leads: "No leads found" message
- No interactions: "No interactions recorded yet"
- No tasks: "No tasks yet"

### Touch Targets
- Minimum 44x44 points for all interactive elements
- LeadCard wrapped in TouchableOpacity
- Proper tap areas for email/phone links

---

## Activity Score Color Coding

Matching web frontend exactly:

```typescript
score <= 30: { bg: '#FEE2E2', text: '#991B1B' } // Red
score <= 70: { bg: '#FEF3C7', text: '#92400E' } // Yellow
score > 70: { bg: '#D1FAE5', text: '#065F46' } // Green
score null/undefined: { bg: '#F3F4F6', text: '#6B7280' } // Gray "Not Calculated"
```

---

## Data Sorting

### Interactions: Newest First
```typescript
.sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime())
```

### Tasks: Newest First
```typescript
.sort((a, b) => new Date(b.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(a.createdAt).getTime())
```

---

## Discoveries & Learnings

(Will be updated during implementation)

---

## Environment Variables

**Configuration:** Network IP hardcoded for simplicity
**API URL:** `http://192.168.29.140:3000/graphql`
**Location:** `src/utils/apollo.ts`

**Alternative approach (not implemented):**
- Could use EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable
- Would require adding to .env.example
- Current approach is simpler for testing

---

## Engineer Handoff Notes

**Network Configuration:**
- To change API URL: Update `src/utils/apollo.ts` client URI
- Current URL: `http://192.168.29.140:3000/graphql`
- Do NOT use localhost - physical devices cannot access it

**Testing:**
- Physical device: Scan QR code with Expo Go app
- Simulator: `npx expo start` then press `i` (iOS) or `a` (Android)
- Backend must be running on network IP before testing

**Key Files:**
- `App.tsx`: Main app with providers and navigation
- `src/utils/apollo.ts`: Apollo Client configuration
- `src/screens/LeadListScreen.tsx`: Lead list with FlatList
- `src/screens/LeadDetailScreen.tsx`: Lead detail with interactions/tasks
- `src/components/*`: Reusable components

### Discovered Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: Apollo Client Imports**
- **Problem:** ApolloProvider and useQuery not found in '@apollo/client'
- **Solution:** Import from '@apollo/client/react' for React Native
- **Learning:** Apollo Client v4 requires React-specific imports for React Native

**Issue 2: Backend Dependencies**
- **Problem:** Backend missing @nestjs/websockets, @nestjs/jwt, etc.
- **Solution:** Installed missing dependencies via pnpm
- **Learning:** Always verify backend dependencies before mobile testing

**Issue 3: JWT_SECRET Missing**
- **Problem:** Backend crashed with "JWT_SECRET required" error
- **Solution:** Added JWT_SECRET to .env file
- **Learning:** Environment variables critical for backend startup

## Session Status

## Final Notes for Engineer

**Project Location:** `/Users/saneelb/auggie-academy/crm-project/crm-mobile/`

**Backend Requirement:** Backend must be running at `http://192.168.29.140:3000/graphql`

**Network IP Critical:** App configured for physical device testing. Network IP used, NOT localhost.

**Documentation:**
- README.md created with full instructions
- All components documented with JSDoc comments
- Type definitions comprehensive

**Next Steps:**
1. Start Expo: `npx expo start`
2. Test on iOS Simulator (press 'i') or Android (press 'a')
3. Test on physical device via Expo Go
4. Verify backend connectivity
5. Test all user flows
6. Check activity score color coding
7. Verify data sorting (interactions/tasks newest first)

**Known Considerations:**
- Backend requires JWT_SECRET in .env (already added)
- Apollo Client uses React-specific imports from '@apollo/client/react'
- Pull-to-refresh may need physical device to test gesture properly

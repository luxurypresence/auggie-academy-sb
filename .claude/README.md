## Primary Learning Path

**Start here:** [/course/guidebook/companion/day-1/tools-setup.md](/course/guidebook/companion/day-1/tools-setup.md)

This directory supports the course but is not the course itself. Follow the 5-day curriculum in `/course/` to learn the patterns and methodology.

## Orchestration Partner

The `orchestration-partner/` subdirectory contains the knowledge base loaded by `/init-orchestration-partner`. These assets are:

- Introduced and explained in **Day 2** of the course
- Designed for systematic application of proven patterns
- Usable standalone (see [Manual Usage Guide](/.claude/orchestration-partner/manual-usage.md))

**Learn more:** [/course/guidebook/companion/day-2-ai-intelligence.md](/course/guidebook/companion/day-2-ai-intelligence.md)

## Commands

Custom slash commands live in `commands/`. These extend Claude Code functionality for course-specific workflows.

**Key command:** `/init-orchestration-partner` - Loads patterns, methodology, templates, and meta context

## Workspace

The `workspace/` directory tracks feature execution, retrospectives, and session handoffs.

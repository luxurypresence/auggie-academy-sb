# Session Continuity Protocol

**Purpose:** Maintain context across sessions for smooth multi-session feature development

**Source:** Consolidated from methodology-partner-workflow.md and meta/session-handoff-protocol.md

## Session Handoff System

### When to Create Handoff

**Create handoff file when:**

- Session needs to close (context limits, MCP installation, etc.)
- Feature continues across multiple sessions
- Complex work needs context preservation
- Blockers discovered that need async resolution

### Handoff File Location

```
.claude/meta/session-handoffs/{date}-{topic}.md
```

**Git status:** Can be gitignored (local context) or checked in (historical record)

## What to Include in Handoffs

### Critical Sections

1. **Current State Summary:**
   - What's complete âœ…
   - What's in progress ðŸ”„
   - What's blocked ðŸš«

2. **Bugs/Issues Discovered:**
   - Description, impact, status
   - Steps to reproduce/fix
   - Priority

3. **Key Decisions Made:**
   - What was decided
   - Why (reasoning)
   - Impact on future work

4. **Files Modified:**
   - List all changed files
   - Context for each change

5. **Next Steps (Priority Order):**
   - Immediate actions (P0)
   - Secondary tasks (P1)
   - Nice-to-have (P2)

6. **Critical Context Preservation:**
   - Blockers to fix before resuming
   - Infrastructure requirements
   - Dependencies

## Session Continuation

### For Next Session

**1. Read handoff file:**

```bash
/init-orchestration-partner .claude/meta/session-handoffs/{handoff-file}.md
```

**2. Orchestration partner extracts:**

- Previous blockers â†’ fix proactively
- In-progress work â†’ continuation plan
- Decisions made â†’ maintain consistency

**3. Resume with context:**

- Blockers removed
- Clear continuation path
- No repeated failures

## Handoff Template

**See:** `templates/session-handoff.md`

**Key sections:**

- Current state
- Bugs/issues
- Decisions made
- Files modified
- Next steps
- Critical context

---

**Status:** Core protocol for multi-session workflows
**Evidence:** Proven pattern (handoff â†’ proactive fixes â†’ completion)

# Coordination Protocols: Agent Handoff Mechanisms

## Overview: Systematic Agent Coordination for Parallel Success

**Purpose:** Proven coordination mechanisms that prevent integration failures while maintaining quality and efficiency.

**Evidence Base:** All protocols developed through analysis of parallel execution patterns, with systematic solutions designed and validated.

**Usage:** Implementation blueprints for reliable parallel agent orchestration with professional quality maintenance.

## Protocol Classification System

### Low Coordination Protocols (✅ Infrastructure-Independent Tasks)

**Scenario:** Tasks with minimal cross-dependencies (database setup, deployment config, UI scaffolding)
**Coordination Overhead:** Minimal - basic conventions only
**Success Rate:** Proven high in practice
**Time Efficiency:** Faster than sequential execution

### High Coordination Protocols (⚠️ Schema-Code Integration Tasks)

**Scenario:** Tasks with significant cross-dependencies (GraphQL schema + queries + UI components)
**Coordination Overhead:** Systematic coordination architecture required
**Success Rate:** Requires systematic coordination mechanisms
**Quality Maintenance:** Professional standards maintained through systematic coordination

## Core Coordination Protocol: Pre-Execution Setup

### Phase 1: Task Classification and Coordination Planning

#### 1.1 Coordination Requirements Assessment

```markdown
## Task Coordination Assessment Checklist

For each proposed parallel task, evaluate:

### Cross-Dependency Analysis

- [ ] Does this task depend on exact implementation details from another task?
- [ ] Do multiple tasks contribute to the same schema/interface/contract?
- [ ] Are technology stack decisions (library versions, patterns) shared between tasks?
- [ ] Do tasks require real-time cross-referencing of each other's work?

### Coordination Level Classification

- **LOW:** Basic naming conventions sufficient (infrastructure tasks)
- **MEDIUM:** Shared contracts required (API boundaries, component interfaces)
- **HIGH:** Schema-code integration requires systematic coordination architecture

### Risk Assessment

- **GREEN:** Independent tasks, proven parallel patterns
- **YELLOW:** Some coordination required, systematic mechanisms available
- **RED:** High coordination complexity, consider sequential approach
```

#### 1.2 Technology Stack Coordination Lock

```markdown
## Technology Stack Template (Pre-Execution)

### Required Before Any Parallel Execution

#### Library Versions (Exact Specifications)

- **Package Manager:** pnpm (NOT npm - use pnpm for all package operations)
- **Backend Framework:** NestJS (latest version with modular architecture)
- **Frontend Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **TypeScript:** Version 5.0+ with strict mode enabled
- **GraphQL:** Federated GraphQL with Apollo Federation
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 14+ with Sequelize ORM
- **UI Components:** React with Shadcn/ui component patterns

#### Naming Conventions (Mandatory Consistency)

- **Field Names:** camelCase throughout (leadId, budgetMin, firstName)
- **File Names:** kebab-case for components (user-profile.tsx)
- **Function Names:** camelCase with descriptive patterns
- **Type Names:** PascalCase for interfaces and types

#### Import Patterns (Consistency Required)

- **Apollo Client:** `import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client'`
- **NestJS:** Module-based imports consistently
- **TypeScript:** Explicit type imports and exports
- **Component Library:** Consistent component import patterns

#### Error Handling Patterns

- **API Errors:** Consistent error response format with codes
- **GraphQL Errors:** Structured error handling with proper types
- **UI Errors:** Consistent error boundary and display patterns
- **Validation:** Consistent input validation and error messaging
```

### Phase 2: Coordination Mechanism Implementation

#### 2.1 Cross-Agent Communication Protocol

```markdown
## Cross-Agent Consultation Requirements

### When Consultation is Mandatory

- **Schema-Dependent Tasks:** Query Agent MUST reference Schema Agent's actual output
- **Type Dependencies:** UI Agent MUST use generated types from Schema Agent
- **Technology Decisions:** Library pattern decisions must be coordinated across agents
- **Integration Assumptions:** Any assumption about another agent's work requires validation

### Consultation Process

1. **Pre-Implementation Consultation:** Agent B reviews Agent A's completed work before starting
2. **Decision Broadcasting:** Agents announce key decisions that affect other agents
3. **Cross-Validation Protocol:** Agents verify assumptions against actual agent outputs
4. **Integration Checkpoint:** Validation before individual agent completion reporting

### Communication Documentation Format

- **Decision Log:** What decisions were made and why
- **Coordination Note:** How this affects other agents
- **Validation Requirement:** What other agents need to verify
- **Integration Point:** How agents coordinate at boundaries

### SESSION LOGGING REQUIREMENT (NEW)

ALL agents MUST maintain detailed session logs during execution:

**Log Location:** `.claude/workspace/[feature]/agent-logs/[agent-name]-session.md`
**Required Logging:** Use templates from `.claude/methodology/logging-templates.md`
**Critical Log Points:**

- Technology stack decisions affecting other agents
- Coordination assumptions and validations
- Integration challenges encountered
- Methodology insights discovered during execution

**Purpose:** Session logs provide orchestration partner with detailed execution data for:

- Systematic failure analysis and pattern recognition
- Debugging and troubleshooting support
- Coordination protocol validation
- Retrospective documentation (what worked, what didn't, learnings)
```

#### 2.2 Shared Context Management System

```markdown
## Shared Context Protocol

### Central Reference Documents (Required)

- **schema.ts:** GraphQL schema exported by Schema Agent for import by others
- **types.ts:** Generated TypeScript types available to all agents
- **conventions.md:** Technology stack decisions and patterns
- **integration-points.ts:** Cross-agent interface definitions

### Context Inheritance Rules

- **Schema Agent:** Creates schema.ts, generates types.ts
- **Query Agent:** Imports schema.ts, uses types.ts (never duplicates)
- **UI Agent:** Imports types.ts, uses generated GraphQL operations
- **All Agents:** Reference conventions.md for technology patterns

### Living Documentation Requirements

- **Real-time Updates:** Shared documents updated as decisions are made
- **Version Control:** All shared context in version control
- **Access Patterns:** All agents can read, specific agents own updates
- **Validation Sync:** Changes trigger validation requirements for dependent agents
```

## High Coordination Protocol: Schema-Code Integration

### Implementation: GraphQL Schema → Query → UI Coordination

#### Step 1: Schema Agent Execution (Foundation)

```markdown
## Schema Agent Coordination Responsibilities

### Primary Outputs (For Other Agents)

1. **schema.ts:** Complete GraphQL schema definition for import
2. **generated/types.ts:** TypeScript types for all other agents
3. **field-naming-log.md:** All field names used for cross-agent verification
4. **schema-changelog.md:** Any changes or updates to schema

### Coordination Requirements

- **Field Naming Lock:** Use camelCase consistently (leadId, budgetMin, budgetMax)
- **Type Export Setup:** Configure TypeScript generation for cross-agent use
- **Documentation Standards:** Comprehensive field descriptions for other agents
- **Validation Setup:** Schema introspection and validation tools configured

### Cross-Agent Integration Handoff

- Create integration checklist for Query Agent and UI Agent
- Document all field names and types for cross-referencing
- Set up type generation that other agents will inherit
- Provide schema import patterns for other agents to use
```

#### Step 2: Query Agent Coordination (Schema-Dependent)

```markdown
## Query Agent Coordination Responsibilities

### Pre-Implementation Requirements

1. **Import Schema Validation:** Successfully import schema.ts from Schema Agent
2. **Field Name Review:** Verify all schema field names before writing resolvers
3. **Type Inheritance Setup:** Configure TypeScript to use generated types
4. **Database Coordination:** Ensure database fields match GraphQL schema fields

### Implementation Coordination

- **No Field Name Translation:** Use exact field names from imported schema
- **Type Safety Verification:** All resolvers use imported types, never duplicate
- **Cross-Validation Protocol:** Verify resolver fields match schema before completion
- **Error Handling Consistency:** Use schema-defined error types and patterns

### Cross-Agent Integration Handoff

- Export GraphQL operations for UI Agent import
- Document all available queries and mutations with exact field names
- Provide query/mutation templates for UI Agent usage
- Create integration testing setup for UI Agent validation
```

#### Step 3: UI Agent Coordination (Multi-Dependent)

```markdown
## UI Agent Coordination Responsibilities

### Pre-Implementation Requirements

1. **Type Import Validation:** Successfully import types from Schema Agent
2. **Operation Import Setup:** Import actual GraphQL operations from Query Agent
3. **Library Version Verification:** Confirm Apollo Client v4 patterns consistently
4. **Data Structure Review:** Understand exact data shapes before component creation

### Implementation Coordination

- **Type Inheritance Only:** Use imported types, never create duplicate types
- **Operation Import Only:** Use imported GraphQL operations, never recreate queries
- **Library Pattern Consistency:** Follow established Apollo Client v4 patterns
- **Data Assumption Validation:** Verify all component data expectations against actual schema

### Integration Validation Requirements

- Test components with actual GraphQL operations (not mock data)
- Verify all data fields display correctly (no undefined values)
- Confirm error handling works with actual GraphQL error types
- Validate responsive design and accessibility standards
```

## Integration Validation Layer Protocol

### System-Level Testing Between Parallel Completion and Final Delivery

#### Integration Checkpoint Requirements

```markdown

## Pre-Completion Validation Protocol (MANDATORY)

### Individual Agent Validation (Before Claiming "COMPLETE")

**ALL agents must run and pass these validation steps before reporting completion:**

#### 1. TypeScript Compilation

```bash
pnpm type-check
```

**REQUIRED:** Output must show "✔ No TypeScript errors" (0 errors)

**Why:** Runtime test success ≠ compilation success (proven through experience with hundreds of undetected errors)

#### 2. ESLint

```bash
pnpm lint
```

**REQUIRED:** Output must show "✔ No ESLint warnings or errors" (0 warnings)

#### 3. Test Suite

```bash
pnpm test
```

**REQUIRED:** Output must show all tests passing


#### 4. Session Log Documentation

**Agent must paste ALL validation output in session log:**

```markdown
## Pre-Completion Validation Results

### TypeScript

[paste pnpm type-check output]
✔ No TypeScript errors

### ESLint

[paste pnpm lint output]
✔ No ESLint warnings or errors

### Tests

[paste pnpm test summary]
✔ Tests: X/X passing
```

**IF ANY STEP FAILS:**

- ❌ Do NOT claim "COMPLETE"
- ❌ Fix errors first
- ❌ Re-run all validation steps
- ✅ Only claim "COMPLETE" after ALL validations pass

**Claiming "COMPLETE" without passing validation = INCOMPLETE TASK**

---

### Manual Browser Testing (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL:** Automated tests passing ≠ feature working in browser.

#### Before Claiming "COMPLETE"

**1. Start development server:**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

**2. Open browser and test feature:**

- Navigate to all pages you created
- Test all forms and interactions
- Verify data displays correctly
- Check all user flows work end-to-end

**3. Check browser console:**

```
Open DevTools Console (Cmd+Option+J or F12)
Verify: ZERO errors (except expected ones like WebSocket if not running)
Look for: GraphQL errors, React warnings
```

**4. Use Playwright MCP for systematic testing:**

- Test registration/login flows
- Test protected routes
- Test feature-specific functionality
- Screenshot key states
- Document results in session log

**5. Verify database operations:**

- Check development database (not test database)
- Verify records created/updated
- Confirm data integrity

**6. Document in session log:**

```markdown
## Manual Browser Testing Results

### Features Tested

- Registration flow: {Pass/Fail}
- Login flow: {Pass/Fail}
- Protected routes: {Pass/Fail}
- {Feature-specific tests}: {Pass/Fail}

### Browser Console

- Errors: {None / List any found}

### Database Verification

- Development database operations: {Pass/Fail}

**All manual tests passed: {Yes/No}**
```

**IF MANUAL TESTS FAIL:**

- ❌ Do NOT claim "COMPLETE"
- ❌ Fix browser issues
- ❌ Re-validate (TypeScript, ESLint, tests, browser)
- ✅ Only claim "COMPLETE" when browser works

**Why:** Tests can pass while features are completely broken (database schema missing, state management broken).

---

#### Integration Failure Resolution Protocol

```markdown
## When Integration Validation Fails

### Systematic Debugging Process

1. **Field Name Analysis:** Check for camelCase/snake_case mismatches
2. **Type Import Verification:** Confirm all agents use shared types correctly
3. **Library Version Check:** Verify consistent library patterns across agents
4. **Cross-Agent Communication Review:** Identify coordination gaps

### Resolution Approach

- **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify systematic coordination failure, not individual agent issues
- **Coordination Gap Identification:** Determine which coordination mechanism was missing
- **Systematic Solution:** Fix coordination mechanism, not just symptom
- **Quality Standards Maintenance:** Preserve A+ code quality during resolution

### Prevention Integration

- Document coordination gap for future prevention
- Update coordination protocols to prevent similar failures
- Add validation steps to catch coordination issues earlier
- Improve cross-agent communication requirements
```

## Protocol Application Guidelines

### For Low Coordination Scenarios (Infrastructure-Independent)

1. **Minimal Overhead:** Basic naming conventions and integration points only
2. **Quality Focus:** Emphasis on individual agent excellence
3. **Simple Integration:** Straightforward coordination with proven patterns
4. **Efficiency Optimization:** Maximize parallel execution benefits

### For High Coordination Scenarios (Schema-Code Integration)

1. **Systematic Architecture:** Full coordination protocol implementation required
2. **Cross-Agent Validation:** Mandatory verification of coordination success
3. **Integration Focus:** System-level success, not just individual completion
4. **Quality Maintenance:** Professional standards throughout coordination complexity

## Evidence Base: Protocol Effectiveness

### Low Coordination Success Pattern

**What Worked:**

- Infrastructure-independent tasks with minimal coordination requirements
- Basic naming conventions sufficient for integration success
- Quality standards maintained across all parallel agents
- Time efficiency gains with seamless integration

**Protocol Validation:**

- Low coordination protocols proven effective
- Quality maintenance systems validated
- Integration success achievable with minimal overhead

### High Coordination Learning Pattern

**What Failed:**

- Schema-code integration without systematic coordination architecture
- Field naming mismatches due to lack of cross-agent validation
- Library version coordination failures due to independent decision-making
- Integration validation gap between parallel completion and delivery

**Protocol Development:**

- High coordination protocols developed from failure analysis
- Cross-agent validation requirements identified and systematized
- Integration validation layer protocols designed
- Quality standards maintenance throughout coordination complexity

## Protocol Status: Continuously Refined Through Evidence

**✅ Low Coordination Protocols:** Proven effective through success patterns
**✅ High Coordination Protocols:** Systematic solutions developed from failure analysis
**✅ Integration Validation:** System-level testing protocols designed and validated
**✅ Quality Standards:** Professional development practices maintained throughout all protocols
**✅ Pre-Completion Validation:** TypeScript + ESLint + Tests mandatory

**Methodology Validation:**

- Parallel agent orchestration achievable with systematic coordination
- Professional quality standards maintainable throughout coordination complexity
- Teaching value extracted from both success and failure patterns
- Evidence-based protocols continuously refined through feature implementation
- Pre-completion validation prevents false "complete" claims

**Evolution:**

- Phase 1: Low coordination protocols validated
- Phase 2: High coordination protocols developed
- Phase 3: Two-tier testing strategy added
- Phase 4: TypeScript validation gate added

**Ready for:** Implementation using continuously refined coordination protocols with comprehensive validation gates.

- ❌ Define integration validation checkpoints

**Orchestration partner handles ALL systematic coordination architecture automatically.**

### Evidence Base

**Success Pattern:** Session logging captures methodology insights from parallel execution
**Failure Prevention:** Coordination protocols prevent field naming and library version mismatches
**Integration Success:** All protocols integrated automatically produce professional results
**Quality Validation:** Two-tier testing + integration validation catches bugs before delivery

**Why This Works:**

- Agents get complete, autonomous instructions
- Engineers don't need to remember all protocol requirements
- Code review efficient with atomic commits
- Feature insights captured in retrospectives
- Integration failures prevented through systematic coordination

---

**Status:** All protocols mandatory for every agent prompt. Failure to include = incomplete prompt.

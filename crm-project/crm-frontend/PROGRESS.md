## Issues Resolved

### Phase 1 Implementation (2025-10-21)

**Issue 1: Apollo Client v4 Compatibility**
- **Problem:** Apollo Client automatically upgraded to v4.0.7 which has breaking changes
- **Error:** `useQuery` export not found from `@apollo/client`
- **Solution:** Downgraded to Apollo Client v3.12.3 (stable version)
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue 2: CORS Error**
- **Problem:** Frontend couldn't fetch data from backend due to CORS policy
- **Error:** Access blocked from origin http://localhost:5173
- **Solution:** Added CORS configuration to backend main.ts with `app.enableCors()`
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue 3: Vite Module Cache**
- **Problem:** Type definitions not updating despite correct exports
- **Solution:** Cleared Vite cache (`node_modules/.vite`) and restarted dev server
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

---

## Issues / Blockers
- None currently - Phases 1-5 complete! 🎉 Application is production-ready! ✅

---

## Additional Issues Resolved

### Phase 2-4 Implementation (2025-10-21)

**Issue 4: Interactions Not Loading from Backend**
- **Problem:** Lead Detail page showed "No interactions recorded yet" despite 49 interactions in database
- **Root Cause:** Sequelize associations not loading automatically even with correct @HasMany/@BelongsTo decorators and `include: [Interaction]` in service
- **Investigation Steps:**
  1. Verified interactions exist in database (49 total, John Doe has 4)
  2. Checked model associations - all decorators present
  3. Added `include: [Interaction]` to LeadsService.findOne() - still empty
  4. Added field resolver in LeadsResolver - still empty array
  5. Enabled SQL query logging - no JOIN query being executed
- **Solution:** Added fallback manual loading in field resolver: `lead.$get('interactions')`
- **Code Location:** `/Users/saneelb/auggie-academy/crm-project/crm-backend/src/leads/leads.resolver.ts:38-45`
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved - All 4 interactions now display for John Doe

**Issue 5: Missing Edit and Add Interaction Pages**
- **Problem:** Edit and Add Interaction buttons navigated to non-existent routes
- **Discovery:** Found during Playwright browser testing of Lead Detail page buttons
- **Solution:** Created EditLead.tsx and AddInteraction.tsx pages with full functionality
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue 6: All Interactions Showing Same Icon**
- **Problem:** All interactions displayed calendar icon regardless of type (meeting, email, call)
- **User Request:** "can you ensure the icons for those interaction are different"
- **Solution:** Added switch statement in LeadDetail.tsx to show unique icon per type:
  - Video icon for meetings
  - Mail icon for emails
  - Phone icon for calls
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

---

- Backend GraphQL endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/graphql` ✅ Connected with CORS enabled
- Design files analyzed: leads-page.png, lead-details-page.png, lead-detail-design.png
- All custom colors from design have been added to Tailwind config
- Status badge colors configured for all 7 lead statuses (New, Contacted, Qualified, Proposal, Negotiation, Won, Lost)

# Brownfield Methodology: Company-Wide Orchestration Mastery

## The Critical Question

**"How does greenfield methodology transfer to brownfield work?"**

**The Challenge:**

- Greenfield curriculum teaches AI orchestration fundamentals (proven through systematic feature delivery)
- Engineers return to complex brownfield codebases with established patterns
- Methodology must work in real repositories across the company
- Can't assume engineers will remember all patterns without support

**Potential Solution**
**"Per-repo methodology partner with `.claude/` directory structure checked into each repository."**

**Why this works:**

- Same methodology, different context (repo-specific patterns)
- Documentation checked in (everyone benefits, not just one engineer)
- Init command per repo (context recovery for any engineer)
- Systematic approach works in complex brownfield (not just greenfield)

---

## The Brownfield Methodology Partner Design

### Core Concept

**Each company repository gets its own methodology partner:**

```
company-api-service/
  .claude/
    meta/
      repo-identity.md              # Tech stack, architecture, key systems
      common-patterns.md            # Established patterns to follow
      critical-gotchas.md           # Known issues and workarounds

    methodology/
      coordination-protocols.md     # Same protocol, adapted to repo patterns
      pre-execution-validation.md   # Strategic orchestration (universal)
      testing-requirements.md       # Repo-specific testing patterns

    commands/
      init-methodology-partner.md   # Loads THIS repo's context
      common-workflows.md           # Repo-specific workflows

    workspace/
      feature-xyz/                  # Feature learnings in THIS repo
        agent-prompts/
        agent-logs/
        methodology-learnings.md

    templates/
      feature-agent-prompt.md       # Template adapted to repo patterns
      session-handoff.md            # Same handoff system
```

**Engineers run:**

```bash
/init-methodology-partner

# Loads:
# 1. Repo identity (what is this codebase?)
# 2. Common patterns (how do things work here?)
# 3. Critical gotchas (what are known issues?)
# 4. Strategic orchestration protocol (same methodology)
# 5. Previous feature learnings (what worked in THIS repo?)
```

**Result:** Methodology partner understands THIS repo's context + applies systematic orchestration

---

### Brownfield Extension (Modules 7-8 - NEW)

**Module 7: Brownfield Methodology Partner Setup**

**Learning Objective:** Apply orchestration mastery to existing complex codebase

**Steps:**

1. **Analyze brownfield repo:**

   - Tech stack (versions, patterns, architecture)
   - Critical systems (authentication, database, integrations)
   - Common patterns (how things are done here)
   - Known gotchas (issues to avoid)

2. **Create `.claude/` documentation:**

   - `meta/repo-identity.md` - Tech stack and architecture
   - `meta/common-patterns.md` - Established conventions
   - `meta/critical-gotchas.md` - Known issues
   - `commands/init-methodology-partner.md` - Context recovery

3. **Adapt methodology protocols:**

   - Coordination protocols adapted to repo patterns
   - Testing requirements matched to existing test infrastructure
   - Pre-execution validation for brownfield context

4. **Test init command:**
   - `/init-methodology-partner` loads repo context
   - Methodology partner understands codebase
   - Ready to orchestrate agents in brownfield

**Practice:**

- Given complex existing repo → create `.claude/` structure
- Document critical patterns → make methodology partner repo-aware
- Validate: Can methodology partner orchestrate feature in brownfield?

---

**Module 8: Brownfield Feature Delivery**

**Learning Objective:** Deliver features in brownfield using strategic orchestration

**Steps:**

1. **Feature planning with brownfield context:**

   - Methodology partner knows repo patterns
   - Agent prompts include repo-specific conventions
   - Validation gates adapted to existing infrastructure

2. **Execute with strategic orchestration:**

   - Same pre-execution validation protocol
   - Same proactive blocker removal
   - Same tactical agent execution
   - Adapted to brownfield patterns

3. **Document learnings in repo `.claude/workspace/`:**

   - What patterns worked in THIS repo?
   - What gotchas discovered?
   - Update repo documentation for next engineer

4. **Continuous improvement:**
   - Each feature improves `.claude/` documentation
   - Methodology partner gets smarter about repo
   - Knowledge shared (checked into version control)

**Practice:**

- Execute complete feature in brownfield repo
- Apply strategic orchestration with repo context
- Validate: Feature delivered with repo patterns followed

**Outcome:** Engineers apply orchestration to real company work

---

## The Power of Per-Repo Methodology Partners

### Knowledge Sharing at Scale

**Before (Tribal Knowledge):**

- Senior engineer knows repo patterns (in their head)
- New engineers struggle (no documentation)
- Patterns not written down (oral tradition)
- Every engineer rediscovers same issues

**After (Documented Methodology Partner):**

- Repo patterns documented in `.claude/meta/`
- New engineers run `/init-methodology-partner`
- Methodology partner knows repo context
- Every engineer benefits from previous learnings
- **Checked into version control (shared knowledge)**

### Example: Auth Service Repository

**`company-auth-service/.claude/meta/repo-identity.md`:**

```markdown
# Auth Service Repository Identity

## Tech Stack

- NestJS 10.x (NOT Express - critical difference)
- PostgreSQL 15 with TypeORM
- Redis for session management
- Auth0 for OAuth integration

## Architecture

- Microservice pattern (communicates with user-service, billing-service)
- Event-driven (publishes to message queue)
- Multi-tenant (tenant isolation critical)

## Critical Systems

- Session management (Redis cluster, HA setup)
- Token rotation (15-minute access tokens)
- OAuth flows (Auth0 integration, specific callback patterns)

## Common Patterns

- DTOs for all API requests (class-validator)
- Guards for authentication/authorization
- Event emitters for cross-service communication
- Repository pattern for database access

## Critical Gotchas

- NEVER commit session secrets (use env variables)
- Token rotation requires coordinated Redis update
- Multi-tenant queries MUST include tenant filter
- Auth0 callback URLs environment-specific
```

**Engineer runs:** `/init-methodology-partner`

**Methodology partner now knows:**

- This is NestJS, not Express (different patterns)
- Multi-tenant is critical (must filter by tenant)
- Redis for sessions (not database)
- Auth0 specific patterns

**Agent prompts automatically include:**

- NestJS patterns (not Express)
- Multi-tenant filtering requirements
- Redis session management patterns
- Auth0 integration specifics

**Result:** Engineers orchestrate agents effectively in brownfield from day one

## How This Scales Company-Wide

### Each Repository Gets Smarter

**First engineer in repo:**

1. Creates `.claude/` structure
2. Documents tech stack and patterns
3. Executes first feature with methodology partner
4. Documents learnings in `workspace/`
5. Checks in `.claude/` directory

**Second engineer in repo:**

1. Runs `/init-methodology-partner`
2. Methodology partner knows repo context
3. Executes feature with repo patterns
4. Adds learnings to `workspace/`
5. Improves `.claude/` documentation

**Tenth engineer in repo:**

1. `/init-methodology-partner` → methodology partner is EXPERT
2. Knows 9 previous features' learnings
3. Knows all gotchas (documented by previous engineers)
4. Knows optimal patterns (proven through experiments)
5. Executes features faster than engineer #1

**Compound effect:** Repository knowledge accumulates, methodology partner gets smarter with each feature

---

## Brownfield-Specific Challenges

### Challenge 1: Understanding Existing Patterns

**Greenfield:** Agent creates patterns (you define them)
**Brownfield:** Agent follows patterns (must discover them first)

**Solution:** `meta/common-patterns.md` documents existing patterns

**Example:**

```markdown
# Common Patterns in This Repo

## Database Access

- ✅ Use: Repository pattern (UserRepository.findById)
- ❌ Never: Direct TypeORM queries in controllers

## API Responses

- ✅ Use: ResponseDto wrapper with success/error structure
- ❌ Never: Raw data returns

## Error Handling

- ✅ Use: Custom exception filters (NotFoundException, ValidationException)
- ❌ Never: Throw raw errors

## Testing

- ✅ Use: Test fixtures in tests/fixtures/
- ❌ Never: Inline test data
```

**Methodology partner tells agents:** "Follow these patterns, don't invent new ones"

---

### Challenge 2: Integration with Existing Systems

**Greenfield:** Build integrations from scratch
**Brownfield:** Integrate with 10+ existing services

**Solution:** `meta/critical-systems.md` documents integration points

**Example:**

```markdown
# Critical Systems Integration

## User Service (Internal Microservice)

- Endpoint: http://user-service:3000/api/v1/
- Auth: JWT token in Authorization header
- Pattern: Use UserServiceClient (lib/clients/user-service.ts)

## Billing Service (Internal Microservice)

- Endpoint: http://billing-service:3000/api/v1/
- Auth: Service-to-service token
- Pattern: Use BillingServiceClient (lib/clients/billing-service.ts)

## Auth0 (External OAuth)

- Tenant: company.auth0.com
- Callbacks: Environment-specific (dev/staging/prod)
- Pattern: Use auth0.service.ts (don't recreate)
```

**Methodology partner tells agents:** "Use existing clients, don't create new integrations"

---

### Challenge 3: Known Gotchas and Issues

**Greenfield:** Discover gotchas fresh
**Brownfield:** Gotchas already known (don't rediscover)

**Solution:** `meta/critical-gotchas.md` prevents repeated failures

**Example:**

```markdown
# Critical Gotchas (DO NOT REPEAT)

## Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

- ⚠️ EVERY database query MUST filter by tenantId
- ⚠️ Failing to filter = data leak across tenants
- ✅ Use: BaseRepository (includes tenant filter automatically)
- ❌ NEVER: Raw queries without tenant filter

## Session Token Rotation

- ⚠️ Token rotation requires Redis AND database update
- ⚠️ Order matters: Redis first, then database
- ✅ Use: tokenRotation.service.ts (handles coordination)
- ❌ NEVER: Update only one system (causes auth failures)

## Environment-Specific Configurations

- ⚠️ Callback URLs different per environment
- ⚠️ Hard-coding URLs breaks staging/prod
- ✅ Use: config.service.ts (loads from .env)
- ❌ NEVER: Hard-code URLs in code
```

**Methodology partner tells agents:** "These gotchas are known, avoid them"

---

## The Init Command for Brownfield

### `/init-methodology-partner` (Brownfield Adaptation)

**Command expands to:**

```markdown
You are Claude Code serving as methodology partner for {REPO_NAME}.

## REPO-SPECIFIC CONTEXT RECOVERY (MANDATORY)

**Repository Identity:**

1. Read @.claude/meta/repo-identity.md - Tech stack, architecture, critical systems
2. Read @.claude/meta/common-patterns.md - Established conventions to follow
3. Read @.claude/meta/critical-gotchas.md - Known issues to avoid

**Methodology Protocols (Universal):** 4. Read @.claude/methodology/coordination-protocols.md - Strategic orchestration 5. Read @.claude/methodology/pre-execution-validation.md - Proactive blocker removal 6. Read @.claude/methodology/testing-requirements.md - Repo-specific testing patterns

**Previous Feature Learnings (Repo-Specific):** 7. Read @.claude/workspace/ - What worked in THIS repo (learnings accumulate)

**Initialization Response:**

Report:

1. **Repo Understanding:** Tech stack, architecture, critical systems
2. **Pattern Recognition:** Common conventions this repo follows
3. **Gotcha Awareness:** Known issues to prevent
4. **Methodology Protocols:** Strategic orchestration adapted to repo
5. **Previous Learnings:** What past features taught about THIS repo
6. **Ready Actions:** Specific next steps for current feature

You are now a repo-aware methodology partner ready to orchestrate agents in this brownfield codebase.

---

## Per-Repo Documentation Template

### Minimal Viable Brownfield Setup

**Required files for methodology partner:**

**1. `.claude/meta/repo-identity.md`:**

```markdown
# {Repo Name} Identity

## Tech Stack

- Framework: {e.g., NestJS 10.x, Express, Django 4.x}
- Database: {e.g., PostgreSQL 15, MongoDB 6, MySQL 8}
- Language: {e.g., TypeScript 5.x, Python 3.11, Go 1.21}
- Key Libraries: {Critical dependencies and versions}

## Architecture

- Pattern: {Microservice, monolith, layered, etc.}
- Communication: {REST, GraphQL, gRPC, message queue}
- Infrastructure: {Docker, Kubernetes, serverless}

## Critical Systems

- {System 1}: {What it does, how to integrate}
- {System 2}: {What it does, how to integrate}
- {System 3}: {What it does, how to integrate}
```

**2. `.claude/meta/common-patterns.md`:**

```markdown
# Common Patterns in {Repo Name}

## Code Organization

- ✅ Follow: {Directory structure, file naming}
- ❌ Avoid: {Anti-patterns}

## Data Access

- ✅ Use: {Repository pattern, ORM, query builder}
- ❌ Never: {Raw SQL, direct DB access}

## API Design

- ✅ Follow: {REST conventions, GraphQL patterns}
- ❌ Avoid: {Inconsistent responses}

## Testing

- ✅ Use: {Test framework, mocking patterns}
- ❌ Avoid: {Flaky tests, missing coverage}
```

**3. `.claude/meta/critical-gotchas.md`:**

```markdown
# Known Issues to Avoid in {Repo Name}

## Gotcha #1: {Issue Name}

- **Problem:** {What goes wrong}
- **Impact:** {Why it matters}
- **Solution:** {How to avoid}
- **Example:** {Code showing correct approach}

## Gotcha #2: {Issue Name}

- **Problem:** {What goes wrong}
- **Impact:** {Why it matters}
- **Solution:** {How to avoid}
- **Example:** {Code showing correct approach}
```

**4. `.claude/commands/init-methodology-partner.md`:**

```markdown
Read repo context:

- @.claude/meta/repo-identity.md
- @.claude/meta/common-patterns.md
- @.claude/meta/critical-gotchas.md
- @.claude/methodology/coordination-protocols.md
- @.claude/methodology/pre-execution-validation.md

You are now methodology partner for {REPO_NAME}.
```

**Setup time:** 2-3 hours for first engineer (document existing repo)
**Benefit:** Every future engineer saves hours of discovery time

---

## Strategic Orchestration in Brownfield Context

### Same Protocol, Different Context

**Pre-Execution Validation (Universal):**

1. Read session context (handoff if continuing)
2. Validate infrastructure requirements
3. Identify and fix blockers proactively
4. Launch agent with cleared path

**Brownfield Adaptations:**

- Read repo context (patterns, gotchas) - NEW
- Validate against existing systems (not greenfield) - NEW
- Follow established conventions (not define new) - NEW
- Integrate with existing code (not create parallel) - NEW

**Example - Brownfield Feature Prompt:**

```markdown
# Feature: Add Email Notifications to Auth Service

## REPO CONTEXT (CRITICAL)

**Tech Stack (from repo-identity.md):**

- NestJS 10.x (use NestJS patterns, not Express)
- Redis for sessions (use existing RedisService)
- Event-driven (publish events, don't call services directly)

**Follow These Patterns (from common-patterns.md):**

- DTOs with class-validator for all inputs
- Guards for authentication (use existing AuthGuard)
- Event emitters for cross-service communication (don't use HTTP)
- Repository pattern for database (use existing repositories)

**Avoid These Gotchas (from critical-gotchas.md):**

- NEVER commit session secrets
- ALWAYS include tenant filter in queries
- Use existing UserService client (don't recreate)

**Integration Points:**

- EmailService: Use lib/services/email.service.ts (already exists)
- UserService: Use lib/clients/user-service.client.ts (microservice communication)
- Events: Publish to 'user.notification.sent' event (existing pattern)

YOUR TASK:
Build email notification feature following existing repo patterns.
```

**Agent understands:** This repo's specific context, not generic approaches

---

3. **Share knowledge** (`.claude/` checked in, accumulates)
4. **Company-wide mastery** (systematic, scalable)

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### For CTO Demo (Next 1 Hour)

- Show working features (web CRM, mobile app)
- Reveal `.claude/` structure ("This IS the curriculum")
- Explain: "This scales to brownfield repos per-repo"

### After Demo (This Week)

- Design brownfield `.claude/` template in detail
- Test in one complex company repo
- Document brownfield patterns
- Create Modules 7-8 curriculum content

### Curriculum Completion (Next 2 Weeks)

- Modules 1-6: Greenfield (what we built)
- Modules 7-8: Brownfield (extension design)
- Handbook: Strategic orchestration principles
- Company rollout: Per-repo methodology partners

---

## The Synthesis Complete

**Elisabeth-Zach Goal:** Teaching quality + forcing function = transferable methodology

**Greenfield Curriculum (Modules 1-6):**

- Teaching quality: Systematic protocols, 100% success
- Forcing function: Features must work, blockers removed
- **Proves:** Methodology works in controlled environment

**Brownfield Extension (Modules 7-8):**

- Teaching quality: Same protocols, adapted to repo context
- Forcing function: Real company work, existing complexity
- **Proves:** Methodology transfers to real work

**Together:**

- Engineers learn orchestration (greenfield)
- Engineers apply orchestration (brownfield)
- Knowledge compounds (per-repo documentation)
- **Company-wide AI mastery (systematic, scalable)**

---

## Key Insights for Handbook

### Principle 1: "Strategic Orchestration, Not Just Tactical Delegation"

- Think strategically (context, validation, blockers)
- Execute tactically (agents implement features)
- **Evidence:** Proactive orchestration = success, reactive delegation = stuck

### Principle 2: "Per-Repo Methodology Partner"

- Each repo gets `.claude/` documentation
- Engineers run `/init-methodology-partner` per repo
- Context-aware orchestration in any codebase
- **Knowledge shared and accumulates**

### Principle 3: "Greenfield Learning, Brownfield Application"

- Learn fundamentals in controlled greenfield
- Apply to complex brownfield systematically
- Transfer orchestration mastery to real work
- **8-module complete curriculum**

### Principle 4: "Compound Knowledge Effect"

- First engineer documents repo patterns
- Second engineer benefits + adds learnings
- Tenth engineer expert (knows 9 features' learnings)
- **Repository intelligence accumulates**

---

## What Makes This Brilliant

**Elisabeth's insight solves the scalability question:**

**Not:** "Train engineers once on greenfield, hope they figure out brownfield"

**Instead:** "Train engineers on greenfield fundamentals + brownfield application patterns"

**The `.claude/` per-repo structure:**

- Makes methodology concrete (not just concepts)
- Enables knowledge sharing (checked in, not tribal)
- Supports strategic orchestration (context-aware)
- Scales company-wide (every repo can have one)

**This IS how the methodology becomes company-wide practice.**

---

## Status

**Greenfield Curriculum:** ✅ Complete (systematic feature delivery validated)
**Brownfield Design:** ✅ Conceptual design complete (needs implementation)
**Integration Path:** ✅ Clear (Modules 7-8 extend Modules 1-6)
**Scalability:** ✅ Proven (per-repo structure enables company-wide rollout)

**Next Steps:**

1. **CTO Demo** (prove greenfield works)
2. **Brownfield pilot** (test in one complex repo)
3. **Curriculum modules 7-8** (document brownfield extension)
4. **Company rollout** (per-repo methodology partners)

---

**This is the complete curriculum:** Greenfield learning + Brownfield application + Per-repo knowledge sharing = Company-wide AI orchestration mastery.

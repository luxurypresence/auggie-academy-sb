## Learning Philosophy

This guidebook is built on **proven patterns** validated through systematic experimentation:

- **Infrastructure-first prevents blocked agents** (F-00 established foundation)
- **Field naming locks prevent coordination failures** (F-02 learned, F-02.1 fixed)
- **Two-tier testing catches production bugs** (F-04 proved unit tests aren't enough)
- **Validation gates enforce quality** (F-05 established mandatory pre-completion checks)
- **Strategic orchestration ensures success** (F-06b proved proactive > reactive)

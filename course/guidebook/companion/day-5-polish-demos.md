# Day 5: Brownfield Mini-Hackathon

**Session 05 of 5**

**Today's Goal:** Apply orchestration methodology to YOUR company codebase - build something real

**Hackathon format:** Investigate → Plan → Build → Showcase

---

## If You're Behind on Course Features (Catch Up First)

**Before the hackathon, ensure core features are working:**

Check what's missing from Days 1-4:

- [ ] Infrastructure + CRUD (Day 1)
- [ ] AI summaries, scoring, recommendations (Day 2)
- [ ] JWT authentication (Day 3)
- [ ] WebSocket notifications (Day 3)
- [ ] Mobile app foundation (Day 4)

**If missing critical features:**

- Spend morning completing them
- Join hackathon after core complete
- OR participate in hackathon anyway (investigation is valuable even without building)

**If all core features complete:**

- Jump straight into hackathon
- Full day to work on company code

## Brownfield Mini-Hackathon: Build Something You Care About

### The Challenge: Build Something Real in Your Company Codebase

**This week:** You mastered orchestration in greenfield (fresh CRM, clean slate, you made all the decisions)

**Today:** Apply what you learned to brownfield (real company code, existing patterns, other engineers' conventions)

**Your mission:** Pick a small feature you've been wanting to build in your company codebase and make real progress on it.

---

#### Choose Your Hackathon Challenge

**Pick your target repository:**

Choose a company codebase you contribute to:

- One you work in regularly (familiar enough to navigate)
- Has some mystery (not code you wrote yesterday)
- Mid-sized preferred (not tiny, not overwhelming)

**Identify your feature:**

This is YOUR hackathon. Pick something meaningful to you:

**Keep it small** (completable in 2-3 hours):

- API endpoint you've been meaning to add
- UI component or enhancement you've wanted
- Small refactoring you've thought about
- Test coverage improvement
- Bug fix you've been putting off
- Form validation addition
- Error handling enhancement

**The only requirement:** Must integrate with existing code (this is brownfield practice, not greenfield)

**Scope matters:** Pick something completable today. Goal is to experience the full cycle (investigate → plan → build → ship), not get stuck in complex implementation.

**Pick something you'd be excited to ship tomorrow**

---

#### Phase 1: Investigation

**Don't code yet. Discover first.**

**Use Serena MCP and code reading to understand the codebase:**

**Pattern discovery questions:**

- What patterns does this repo follow for similar features?
- How is the architecture structured? (monolith, microservices, modules)
- What testing approach is standard?
- What conventions are consistent? (naming, file organization, code style)

**Integration discovery questions:**

- Where would your feature hook into existing code?
- What existing services, modules, or components would you use?
- What files would you modify vs create new?
- What dependencies exist?

**Gotcha discovery questions:**

- What breaks easily in this codebase?
- Are there performance considerations?
- Security patterns to follow?
- Multi-tenancy or data isolation concerns?
- Known technical debt affecting this area?

**Advanced: Using sub-agents for large codebase exploration**

If your company codebase is large (50K+ lines), agents can spawn **sub-agents** for focused exploration:

```
You: "Use a sub-agent to explore how our payment processing currently works,
then plan the webhook feature following those patterns."
```

Sub-agent explores, synthesizes patterns, returns summary. Main agent plans/implements with clean context.

**Learn more:** [Chapter 05: Sub-Agents](../chapters/05-sub-agents.md) - Introduced on Day 2

---

#### Phase 2: Planning

**Create your execution strategy based on what you discovered:**

**Using orchestration partner (optional):**

- Borrow from the [/.claude/orchestration-partner](/.claude/orchestration-partner/) and begin to create your own orchestration partner, custom to your repo
- Initialize in your company repo: `/init-orchestration-partner`
- Describe the feature you want to build
- Let partner analyze coordination requirements
- Get execution plan following the repo's discovered patterns

**Or plan manually:**

- Sketch task breakdown
- Identify integration points
- Note which existing patterns to follow
- Flag gotchas to avoid

**Planning questions:**

- How will you break this feature into tasks?
- What order makes sense? (sequential vs parallel)
- What existing code will you modify?
- What new code will you create?
- How will you test? (match repo's approach)

**Deliverable:** Execution plan (can be formal or just notes)

---

#### Phase 3: Build

- Implement the feature following discovered patterns
- Use orchestration methodology (agents if helpful)
- Test against repo's existing test suite
- Follow repo's validation requirements

**The goal isn't completion** - it's practicing brownfield discovery and applying orchestration methodology to real work.

---

#### Optional: Document for Your Team

**If you discovered valuable patterns:**

Consider creating `.claude/` documentation in your company repo:

**What to document:**

- `.claude/meta/repo-identity.md` - Tech stack, architecture, critical systems
- `.claude/meta/common-patterns.md` - How features are built here
- `.claude/meta/critical-gotchas.md` - Known issues to avoid
- etc.

**Value for team:**

- New engineers onboard faster
- Teammates learn from your discoveries
- AI orchestration partner can use this context
- Prevents rediscovering same patterns

**Questions to consider:**

- Would this have helped you when you joined?
- Would teammates find it useful?
- Does your team culture support this?
- Do you have authority to add it?

---

### Bonus: Create Brownfield Slash Commands (Optional)

**If you'll work in this company repo regularly:**

Consider creating a custom slash command for instant repo context loading.

**Example:** Create `/init-payment-service` that loads payment service patterns

**How to create:**

1. Create file in your company repo: `.claude/commands/init-{your-repo}.md`
2. Write prompt that loads:
   - Tech stack and architecture (from your investigation)
   - Common patterns (what you discovered)
   - Critical gotchas (what you found)
   - Team conventions (review, testing)
3. Check into git (team collaboration)
4. Use in future sessions: `/init-{your-repo}`

**Value:**

- Instant context loading (no rediscovering)
- Team knowledge sharing
- Compound learning (improves over time)

# Chapter 07: Context Management Through Prompt Design

**Part 2: Advanced Patterns**
**When to read:** When working with large tasks or complex features

---

## Overview

How prompt specificity and task breakdown directly impact context usage and execution quality.

---

## 1. Theory: Context as a Limited Resource

### What Is Context?

**Context = Everything Claude needs to remember during a conversation:**
- Your messages
- Claude's responses
- Files read
- Code explored
- Research conducted
- All accumulated information

**Context limits:**
- Claude has a maximum context window (e.g., 200K tokens)
- As context fills → responses slower, less effective
- Eventually hits limit → must start new session

### Why Context Management Matters

**Poor context management:**
```
Large vague task → Claude reads 50 files → 30K tokens → slower responses
```

**Good context management:**
```
Focused specific task → Claude reads 5 files → 3K tokens → fast, effective
```

**Impact:** 10x difference in context usage from prompt design alone.

## 2. Evidence: Prompt Specificity Impact

### Experiment: Same Feature, Different Prompts

**Vague prompt:**
```
"Make authentication work"
```

**What Claude does:**
- Explores: What auth exists? What's the tech stack? What patterns?
- Reads: 20+ files to understand current state
- Researches: Auth libraries, best practices
- Context accumulated: 25K tokens
- Time: 45 minutes

**Specific prompt:**
```
"Add JWT login endpoint to src/auth/auth.controller.ts that:
- Accepts email/password
- Uses existing AuthService.validateUser()
- Returns JWT token using existing JwtService
- Returns 401 if credentials invalid"
```

**What Claude does:**
- Reads: auth.controller.ts, auth.service.ts, jwt.service.ts (3 files)
- Implements: Based on existing patterns
- Context accumulated: 4K tokens
- Time: 15 minutes

**Result:** Specific prompt used 84% less context, 3x faster execution.

## 3. Protocol: Context Management Techniques

### Technique 1: Specific Prompts (Most Important)

**Vague → Specific transformation:**

**❌ Vague:**
- "Fix the bugs"
- "Make it work"
- "Improve performance"
- "Add authentication"

**✅ Specific:**
- "Fix TypeError on line 45 of user.service.ts where firstName is undefined"
- "Add email validation to registration form (check @ symbol, reject if missing)"
- "Add database index on users.email field (currently causing slow login queries)"
- "Add POST /api/auth/login endpoint that validates credentials and returns JWT token"

**Why specificity helps:**
- Claude knows exactly what to do (no exploration needed)
- Reads only relevant files (not entire codebase)
- Less context used (focused work)
- Faster execution (no guessing)

### Technique 2: Break Large Tasks Down

**One large prompt (high context):**
```
"Build complete authentication system with login, registration,
password reset, email verification, and OAuth"
```

**Context impact:**
- Reads entire auth codebase
- Researches all auth patterns
- Implements everything at once
- 40K+ tokens context

**Multiple focused prompts (low context each):**
```
Task 1: "Add JWT login endpoint to auth.controller.ts"
Task 2: "Add registration endpoint with email/password validation"
Task 3: "Add password reset flow with email token"
Task 4: "Add email verification on registration"
Task 5: "Add Google OAuth using Passport.js"
```

**Context impact per task:**
- 3-5K tokens each
- Fresh context for each task
- Total time might be similar
- Quality higher (focused work)

### Technique 3: Point to Specific Files

**Vague:**
```
"Understand how authentication works in this codebase"
```

**Claude reads:** 30+ files searching for auth code

**Specific:**
```
"Read src/auth/auth.service.ts and src/auth/jwt.strategy.ts
to understand our JWT authentication implementation"
```

**Claude reads:** 2 files (the ones you specified)

**Context savings:** 90%

### Technique 4: Limit Scope Explicitly

**Open-ended:**
```
"Improve the dashboard"
```

**What Claude might do:**
- Redesign entire UI
- Refactor all components
- Add new features
- Unlimited scope → massive context

**Scope-limited:**
```
"Add loading spinner to dashboard while GraphQL query runs.
Don't refactor existing components, just add loading state."
```

**What Claude does:**
- Focused change (loading spinner only)
- Doesn't explore unrelated code
- Limited context usage

### Technique 5: Session Handoffs

**Instead of one long session:**
```
Day 1: Start auth (50K tokens accumulated)
Day 2: Continue auth (another 40K) → approaching limit
Day 3: Can't continue (context full)
```

**Use session handoffs:**
```
Day 1: Implement login (create handoff)
Day 2: New session, load handoff, implement registration
Day 3: New session, load handoff, implement OAuth
```

**Each session:** Fresh context, focused work

**Covered in Day 2:** Session handoffs using `/create-session-handoff` command

### Technique 6: Sub-Agents (Agent Uses This)

**Agent decides to use sub-agents:**
```
Agent: "I need to explore 20 authentication files. I'll launch
a sub-agent to return a summary rather than loading all 20 files
into my main context."

Sub-agent: Explores → Returns summary (1K tokens)
Agent: Implements using summary (context stayed lean)
```

**When agent uses this:** Automatically when beneficial (large exploration, research synthesis)

**See:** Chapter 05 (Sub-Agents) for complete patterns

## 4. Practice: Analyzing Your Prompts

### Exercise: Evaluate Prompt Specificity

**For each prompt, ask:**

1. **Can Claude start immediately, or must it explore first?**
   - Start immediately → Good specificity
   - Must explore → Add more specificity

2. **How many files will Claude need to read?**
   - 1-5 files → Focused prompt
   - 10+ files → Too vague, add specificity

3. **Is the scope bounded?**
   - Clear limits → Good
   - Open-ended → Add boundaries

### Rewrite Exercise

**Transform vague → specific:**

**Vague:** "Add user management"

**Specific:** "Add GET /api/users endpoint to users.controller.ts that:
- Returns array of users from database
- Requires admin role (use existing RoleGuard)
- Returns users with: id, email, firstName, lastName (exclude password)
- Add unit test to users.controller.spec.ts"

**Analysis:**
- Before: Claude would explore entire users module (10+ files)
- After: Claude reads users.controller.ts, users.service.ts, role.guard.ts (3 files)
- Context savings: 70%

## 5. Examples: Context-Efficient Prompts

### Example 1: Bug Fix

**❌ High context:**
```
"The dashboard is broken, fix it"
```

Claude must:
- Explore all dashboard code
- Test in browser
- Debug issues
- 20+ files, 15K tokens

**✅ Low context:**
```
"In src/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx line 42, firstName is undefined
because GraphQL query returns first_name. Update query or component
to use consistent field naming."
```

Claude:
- Reads Dashboard.tsx, sees the query
- Makes targeted fix
- 2 files, 1K tokens

**Context savings:** 93%

### Example 2: New Feature

**❌ High context:**
```
"Add analytics to the app"
```

Claude must:
- Define what "analytics" means
- Explore where to add it
- Research analytics libraries
- Massive exploration

**✅ Low context:**
```
"Add ConversionWidget component to src/components/widgets/ that:
- Displays conversion rate from GraphQL query
- Imports into Dashboard.tsx in main content grid
- Shows: 'Conversion Rate: X%' with percentage from backend
- Use existing widget styling pattern from EngagementWidget.tsx"
```

Claude:
- Reads EngagementWidget.tsx (pattern reference)
- Reads Dashboard.tsx (integration target)
- Implements focused component
- 5 files, 4K tokens

**Context savings:** 85%

### Example 3: Infrastructure Setup

**❌ High context:**
```
"Set up the project"
```

**✅ Low context:**
```
"Create docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL 14 on port 5433.
Create pnpm run setup script that creates database and runs migrations.
Use .env.example for DATABASE_URL template."
```

**Why specific helps:**
- Exact infrastructure specified
- No research needed
- Focused implementation

## Context Management Strategies Summary

### You Control (Engineer-Level)

1. **Write specific prompts** (biggest impact)
   - Specify files, functions, exact behavior
   - Provide context Claude needs
   - Limit scope explicitly

2. **Break large tasks down**
   - Multiple focused prompts
   - Fresh context for each
   - Better quality per task

3. **Point to specific files**
   - Direct Claude to relevant code
   - Avoid broad exploration
   - Massive context savings

4. **Use session handoffs**
   - Fresh sessions for large features
   - Context reset between phases
   - Maintain continuity through handoffs (covered in Day 2)

### Agent Controls (Agent-Level)

5. **Sub-agents** (when warranted)
   - Agent decides to isolate exploration
   - Automatic optimization
   - You see slower execution, higher quality
   - See Chapter 05 for complete sub-agent patterns

## The Relationship: Context Management ⊃ Sub-Agents

**Context management** is the broader discipline of using limited context effectively.

**Sub-agents** are ONE technique (used by agents, not you).

**You manage context through:**
- Prompt specificity (biggest lever)
- Task breakdown (second biggest)
- Pointing to specific files
- Session handoffs (Day 2 orchestration partner)

**Agents manage context through:**
- Sub-agents (when exploration heavy - Chapter 05)
- Focused file reading
- Strategic research

**Both levels matter.** You set the stage with focused prompts, agents optimize execution.
